Vince coudn't find Ayer anywhere in the building until he learned that he was, as some of his colleagues were kind enough to tell him, probably down the hallway at the abandoned part of the building, standing up facing the windows. It was there where, according to them, he had spent most of his free time. 

He remembered the place they were talking about. It was near an area of the building remained deserted after the layoffs. While approaching it, Vince though whether it is appropriate of him to bother Ayer this way - he hadn't talked to him in almost a month, and the only reason why he knew where he was was his colleagues' unwanting, or inability, to shut their months. And when he saw Ayer, he also didn't look like he wanted to speak to somebody. Out of his many emotionless expression which Vince had learned to differentiate in the course of the last several months, this one was particularily uninviting. Vince approached him and greeted him formally. Ayer turned his head to him and scanned him from head to toe.

"Hi," he said, his tone indicated that he was doing it merely to obey the social conventions, without putting any emotion, good or bad.

"Cadman, what are you doing here?" Vince said, obeying social conventions of his own.

Ayer did not say anything at first. At the end, he muttered something but it was far from the level of coherence to which Vince was used to from him.

"Don't get me wrong I always thought that this halway was pretty nice place." Vince continued "- it is just that it don't _go_ anywhere, you know?

"My room also doesn't go anywhere."

"Yeah but... What's happenining, Ayer?" Vince was confused so he thought that being honest is the best way to attack the situation, "Your manners, your tone... It is almost as you had forgotten whom are you speeking to."

"You think you don't know who you are why are you here?" Ayer stared at him. "You are my boss. You came to me because it's been three months since I started and you must go and talk to be about how this organizations values me et cetera. You pretend to be my friend, although you'd probably prefer to be my parent if you got to pick. And you like me, and feel bad about it. Have I made a mistake so far?"

"Can we now focus on you?" Vince said, but Ayer didn't quit:

"You are married and have two kids from a woman you are friends with, but towards whom you don't feel passionate about. You pretend that you don't need passion, but in fact you do. That is why you need to make up for your live's dullness by flirting with your partner in a way that's, if I may say so, rather clumsy."

"OK, enough!" Vince said. "You got everything correctly. You win. You are good. One of the best in fact, not that this is such a big deal, but you are. But still I am your boss. And now you have to come with me."

---

"So, people say nice things about your work." Vince started, once they sitted themselves in the canteen."

"I don't understand. I did nothing. Den's file is almost empty." Ayer replied.

"Are you kidding? You must have solved ten cases since you got here. And a hundred more, which were solved by the Detective using your ideas. Like we care about Den Lee."

"The Japanese have no records about this person ever existing." Ayer continued. "She was running away from something. I don't have any idea what. But I believe she is the key to finding out what who is behind the odd crimes."

"What? Odd crimes? You still search for that one person who is responsible for all of them?"

"There must be some reason for all this which is happening."

"Maybe yes, maybe no." Vince said, "In any case, why do you bother with it? We capture all perpetrators with zero issues, you do a pretty good job at solving the deviant cases, and after the boffins implement some of the tactics you use into the Detective, it starts tracking similar cases by itself. 

"...by itself." Ayer repeated.

"Yes, by itself." Vince said. "Look, I said it earlier, you are correct - you being an employee of the month is not important. You know what is important though? That if today you submit a patch to the Detective's alghorithm, it will always be there. As long as the infrastructure is there it will always prevent a similar crimes from happening. In effect, we might say that you created an antidode for a given class of crimes. Don't you find this amazing? If not, consider this: If we count the number of solved cases, which is for me the only objective metric, you are probably the most sucessfull investigator ever!" 

Vince raised his voice, trying to grab Ayer's attention, but all he got was a raised eyebrow.

"All I do is to make up and test numerous weird and somewhat absurd ideas, until one of them turns out to be correct in, say, ten percent of the cases. I don't think that this practice is in any way as useful as you present it to be, neither do I think that the numbers are important."

"Weird? Absurd? Nobody else in the whole building could come up with something close to what you do. But I am beggining to think that there is no way for me to make you happy. But you didn't forget, right? We are on a mission..."

"Yeah, on a mission to end crime." Ayer said.

"You are coming tonight, right?" Vince said.

"Are you?"

"I have this meeting early the next day, but I will definitely come by to see you."

Drunk

The party was organized in a rather simple and ad-hoc way. After the working hours had ended all employees were invited to the big conference room, which looked exactly like any other day, except that the chairs were placed next to the walls and some music could be heard from the conference speakers. Vince and the rest of the management (excluding Jane) came for around 10-15 minutes to congratulate Ayer and his team, and they were quick to leave. After that someone delivered pizzas and several kegs of beer which some of Ayer's colleagues attacked immediately. The last time Ayer had drunk alcohol was long time ago but then he decided to pop a few bottles and to indulge in some technical conversations with them. 

"You know, I read they started working of some kind of global database, containing the faces of all people in the world."

"It's about time." Ayer said. "You know how many emigrants from all over the world arrive?"

"No, but I know how to check." Johny replied.

"That was rhetorical." Chad said.

"No it wasn't." Ayer said, "Its about a thousand. 

"But almost no cases involving them." Pankill said, "Except that one that you had to solve originally, right Ayer." 

"Don't remind him about that one," Johny smiled but then he immediately became serious again: "Sorry Ayer, just trying to pull off some jokes here."

"I don't mind it." Ayer said. "Plus I will solve that case someday."

"I don't know about that one, but the one you solved today was rad."

The conversation continued for several hours and Ayer soon felt as relaxed as if he was with people whom he knew very well. Then a boy whom he didn't know at all came to their table and sit next to him. He turned to that boy and without being afraid that someone would notice he scanned his appearance as meticulously as he could.

"Ayer, don't you have any respect of the new colleague's privacy?" Chad yelled from across the room when he noticed Ayer's stare.

"What is 'privacy'?" John asked and everyone that weren't already laughing started doing so.

"Cover yourself!" Chad turned to the boy who was just seeing Ayer looking at him, "Cover yourself with something, or he will read your mind," 

He was almost sick with laughter as were everyone else in the room, except the boy, who looked rather perplexed.

"Don't mind that guy," Allie said. 

"I don't." The boy smiled. "I just don't know what is happening."

"Wait, I have an idea." Chad said."Ayer scan this person again and tell us the most embarrasing things you find out. 

"Come on, Chad." Allie said. "Won't you stop having fun on other people's expense!"

"Fun is not the only thing that he is having on other people's expense, I can tell you that" Johny said and started laughting at his own joke.

"Yeah, won't you do that thing for Chad, Ayer! Why don't you scan Chad and tell us what you find out!"

"I am not scanning anyone," Ayer said. "And I am not using my abilities to embarass people."

"Don't worry, I will take it." The boy said. "Seems interesting."

"Do it Ayer, but be nice, please." Pankill said.

"But not too nice." John added.

"No. Doing this would indicate that I don't take my abilities seriously. And I take them very seriously." 

"Come on, Ayer, you are always using your skills to show off." Chad said.

"That is different." 

"Or maybe you don't see anything you can share with us?"  continued.

"Maybe I don't."

"But do you?" That was the boy. "I want to know whether you are really as good as people claim you to be. And if you want, I won't tell anyone whether you are correct or not. It will be our secret."

"And we still get all the fun from watching you too, sounds like a plan" Johny said and all other people in the room expressed silent agreement to this idea. Their turned their heads to Ayer, almost simultaneously."

"Alright." Ayer said. "Let's begin. I think that your parent are divorced."

Everyone looked at what the boy would say in return, but he acted like he didn't even hear the remark."

"Because of the way their relationship ended you are still afraid to talk to women for fear that you will end up like them," The boy still said nothing.

"That, plus, you had a terrible acne when you were a teenager..." Ayer continued and pointed at a little scar on the boy's forehead, "Decided you will impress people with your brain, not with your looks, but there were people who had the looks and were no less smarter than you... You hated people for being so shallow and you felt you are superior to most of them..." The boy was listening but from his expression he did not seem impressed.

"You masturbated about a hour ago," Ayer said suddenly, "I'd say it was in the toilet next to your office."

"Alright, now you are just making stuff up." Allie said, "Stop it, Ayer!"

"Yeah man, just admit defeat." Johny said. We won't embarras *you*."

Ayer took a closer look at the rest of his companions. They were surrounding him from all sides. They did not look disappointed, but quite the opposite. They were happy. He did what they wanted him to, not because he had to do it, but simply because he wanted to blend in. He was assimilated. It was then he realised that the boffins will never understand him the way he understood them. Not because they could not, but because they would not try. They liked him only because he was interesting. For them he was just a pretty persona, that they felt good having around. None of them attached any significance to the evenings that he/she spent with his/her colleagues, like the current one. For them all these times, all relationships that they have were nothing more than a way to distract themselves and to kill some time. And Ayer did not like to kill time. For some reason he always felt that he does not have enough of it.

Before leaving, he went to talk to the boy while noone else was listened, and asked him why he reacted so calmly to what he said and what part of his assertions were true.

"Well, actually all of them," the boy said. But what difference does that make?"

---

While still slightly sad (and very drunk), Ayer found himself in his office where he came to pick up his jacket. He turned to the wall where he transferred all evidence from his home office. Articles about disapearing people. In Japan there was (or perhaps "there wasn't" Ayer thought and tried to smile like he was still with the boffins) around 100 000 of them every year, mostly out of shame of personal failures. Not clear how many left the country, but searching for Den Lee's identity was next to impossible. He turned to the other wall, where he kept some pictures of Den Lee's dolls. Looking at them reminded him of the last hand-made object that he owned - it was a teacup, rather clumsily made, which he had from year three to around seven. The cup was made from porcelain and was shaped like a figure of fat person, with the person's hands acting like handles for the cup. He remembered how he used to enjoy drinking his milk from that cup before his mother stopped using it in favour of big tea set with identical cups for everyone. The memory dispersed. He looked at Den Lee's dolls again and thought that something so unnatural as them just *had* to be connected, either directly or indirectly, to her case. On his computer he saw the last query that he was working on. He started reading it, but he was appauled by the dumb heuristics that he was using - it now seemed to him that all he did was to consume the ideas and features that OSCAR had "And to think that this shit can actually work?" he thought, "Imagine if some true inspiration was employed with the construction of such query."

Then he sit over his chair and he started typing. What he created was not cheap to run, nor was it pretty in the sense in which boffins used that word when they spoke about code. But it was correct. And when he ran it, it returned exactly one result.

---

Vince entered Jane's office without knocking and sat on her couch.

"That kid again..." Vince said. "Now using his colleague's computers to run some queries."

"They complained?"

"No, they were stone drunk. Probably still are, for that matter," Vince tried to remember whether the boffins were at work that morning. "Look, I know what are you going to say but "No harm done" is not enough for me. If we don't put him on his spot now, there will be no way to control him!

"Then go and do it. Why are you coming here?"

"Jane..."

"Listen, we are in a gigantic mess, that we haven't even begin to untangle. Our most valuable resource has got his resignation in his pocket since day one. And your biggest issue is how to *control* people? You are getting old, Vince. And as King Lear's jester says-"

"OK, I get it. I will keep my mouth shut."

"I am afraid sometimes merely doing nothing is not enough." Jane said. "You know what's Ayer's problem? That the Yard does not give him anything. Like for example, have you actually seen what he did on those computers?" 

"Something very costly. I am not good at computer programming."

"Well," Jane said, "it is about the case of Den Lee. And is near damn brilliant. He basically goes through half of Japans population and it the end her discovers who she was."

"You said this case is bogus."

"I did. But I might be wrong. And even if I am not, would it hurt for him to check? You need to keep employees happy. Give him something that he will like. Help him with that case of his."

The Unexpected Withness
---

He arrived at a small room, which resembled a storehouse. There were two chairs. one of them was occupied by Vince and on the other sat a girl which looked exactly like Den Lee. The girl stood up before Ayer. She made a deep long bow and  Ayer made a clumsy attempt to copy her jesture.

"And you?" he started. "Actually-"

"I am her sister," She replied in perfect English.  
She sat upright, with her toes touching the floor with a posture that made her look like she was about to attack him. Both her toes and her nails were painted with dark nail polish - perhaps to hide signs of biting, but the layer was so thick that he couldn't be sure. She looked like she was about twenty, but she was dressed and made up as a much older woman. The level of sophistication of her wardrobe was unlike what he had seen by people who had recently started living alone, which tended to look a lot more liberated. Perhaps this was a way for her to show character or exactly the opposite - to hide her character from him. If the latter was true, she was doing a perfect job - the amount traits she managed to hide from him was astounding - this was probably the smallest he'd ever known for a living person in a long while. He looked at her and smiled, while trying to relax himself with the fact that it was probably her race that prevented him from seeing a clearer picture of her.

"Mrs Kei Lee is in the city for a few months," Vince entered the conversation, "I contacted her unofficially, after I read the new findings regarding her sister's case and I invited her to talk about your theory."

"I won't going to ask you why didn't you notified me.

Ayer felt like he had to speak althogh the information he had wasn't nearly enough for him to feel confident. With his eyes closed, he started what would turn out to be one of the hardest (and least successful) hearings in his career:

"So firstly I am sorry for your sister," he turned to the girl, "I don't know how it feels to lose a close one, so I am not going to say that I sympathise, but nevertheless take my deepest condolences."

Kei nodded but did not say anything.

"It is particularily unfortunate to see such thing happening to a tallented person like your sister.

"Oh please," She smiled but her eyes did not move an inch, "by now you've probably figured that the crafts were just a hobby for her."

"Alright, what would you consider her *job* then?"

"She did not do anything in particular. She was overcoming some emotional problems, which I would prefer not to discuss."

"Are you positive about the 'nothing' part?"

"I am sure, we spoke often," Kei replied, "We were sending each other letters."

"I don't understand, Vince said. We trace all internet activity, there were zero e-mails sent from her accounts."

"Not e-mails. We were sending each other paper letters," Kei said, "for as long as I remember."

"And where are these letters? Do you have copies?"

"No, I don't have them, they are gone." She said and Vince had a hard time digesting the fact that she was correct - there were absolutely no way to know what information Den had shared with Kei nor with anyone else, for that matter, "but what we discussed in those letters was nothing... material. I doubt that their content would interest you."

"Were you aware of your sister's whereabouts after she ran away?"

"Of course I was," She said, "running away is not always about leaving."

"And was anyone else aware of them?"

"I believe not."

"I think you realize that the more details you share, the more likely it is for us to find out what had happened," Ayer said.

"But I know what happened," the girl said.

"And you are sure?"

"Yes," she lowered her head and for the first time she looked her age, "She had serious issues."

"Serious enough for her to jump out of the window?" Ayer said.

"Like I said I prefer not to discuss this," She remained calm and made Ayer regret his blunt remark.

"What do you make of the call." Ayer asked.

"Nothing," Kei said. "I don't know why she did that."

"You think that someone does?"

"Alright, what do you want me to say," she laid her head on her elbows, written on her face was an emotion that he could not decode, "What response to you hope to get?"

"I want to know the truth." Ayer said.

"Well, you alredy do know the truth. I already told it to you."

"Look, I understand that you don't believe me, and quite frankly I think that you do not care too much about how exactly did your sister die. But before us lays a question, that question surely has an answer and I think it will be good to find it.

"All this is true," Kei said, "however-"

---

As Vince was walking Kei to the door, Ayer realized that she player him out. Her responses were always circumventing his questions, she made a very good use of her position and didn't even give him a chance to ask her some of the things he had in mind like the disapearance of the dolls from her apartment. But maybe she secured herself a bit too much. Because now Ayer was certain that this girl was hiding something. He was sure of this like he was sure that she lied about not having the letters her sister wrote.

Ayer wondered whether there is a point to discuss this with Vince at all. Vince's job was simple - to make sure all procedures were followed properly. In fact it was so simple, that knowing a thing or two about them, Ayer could almost construct the whole dialog that they were about to exchange: "You had your shot, " he'd say, "There are no grounds whatsoever for engaging Kei in any other way. No I won't make an exception. I guess you don't realize that I am already making one by letting you speak to her." Ayer looked at his profile as he was exiting the room and quckly realized that he will never be capable of arguing with this person. He could not argue with someone who had never entered the realm of the abstract. Could not argue with someone good that good was the enemy of the perfect. It looked like this whole investigation was about to come to an end.

Unless...

Ayer focused at the window, which was facing the exit of the building.

Follow the riddle
---

This day the wheather at London was unusually clear and Ayer could see the whole yard of the building up to the metal fence which was surrounding it. When Vince returned, Kei was already out and was walking down the alley that led to the main entrance. At first she started slowly, and then she stopped for a moment like she had noticed something and headed to another direction straight through the garden. Ayer leaned through the window to see the cab which was waiting for her and memorize the brand and the plate number.

"So?" Ayer heard the voice of Vince who had already returned to his chair, "What do you think about this girl?"

"She is cute." Ayer said.

"Cute?"

"Yes, I like her. But I *do* think she is lying. Listen, I have to go now, catch you later, OK?"

And before Vince had a chance to react, he got out of the room and ran to the exit, while simultaneously dialing in the number of the taxi which that Kei used:

"Hallo," he said with the best approximation of a Japanese accent "I want to order a taxi, but my phone is dead... Yes, my name is Cheng Lee..."

It took a second before the boy responded. Ayer used it to make one huge jump and finish off the stairs on his way to the exit.

"The address? Oh, Jee, it was in my phone... No, I don't have a profile. But you know, my wife has one. Can you check the address from her? She's Kei Lee."

He was already running towards the street as the support agent was waiting for Kei's profile to load.

"Yeah, thanks, what is her last trip's destination?"

Ayer closed the phone as soon as he got it and then ordered a cab from another company.

He arrived just in time to see her entering in an old, but well-maintained building at the city center (Ayer immediately crossed out "debt" as a possible reason for Den Lee's disapearance from Japan). He rushed at the other end of the street both to escape from her field of sight and to be able to catch a glimpse of the windows of the staircase as he was passing by and easily traced the apartment where she entered. He knew that that he had to do from this moment on was to wait a little, hoping that his intuition was right, and that she would leave her apartment at the evening.

Kei's Apartment
---

He was sitting in a small Cafe. A few papercups of coffee were rolling on his table, he was holding his phone in front of his face. On its screen, there was a football match he couldn't care less about - placed here to provide him with an oportunity to concentrate on the door of the Kei's apartment, which was just at the other side of the street. 

For some time nothing happened but then he saw her. The next time the waitress came to his table he was gone. Along with the papercups, on his table laid a few crushed banknotes. Ayer rejoiced. He was in nearly perfect shape, and these old buildings with all of their ornaments and bumps were perfect for clmbing. The only thing that could stop him was if someone saw him, but that was next to impossible - people had long stopped paying attention at what was happening around them. That was what the surveilance system is for, right?

In thirty seconds time he was already in. He started going through Kei's personal belongings which were spread throughout the apartment. There were a lot of cosmetics, books written in English and Japanese and also a lot of high-end jevelery which was laying on the desk. A notebook containing text and sketches grabbed Ayer's attention, but going through it proved to be quite useless - even after doing so, in his mind she was even more faceless than she was at the beginning. Nothing that she said or did left a clue about her identity. She was not generic, as some other people for whom there wasn't much to know about to begin with, just faceless - a shadow with a pretty silhoette.

Still, in her night-stand he found, as he expected, the letters that she had exchanged with her sister.

He took the topmost one. Judging by the address, this one was written by Den Lee, but he could guess this by the envelope alone, and by the paint stains that it was covered in. Took another one, which was presumably the response to the first one - it was written by Kei with a very refined handwriting and had such a perfect alignment that he almost wished it wasn't so perfect, looking for the invisible, (or perhaps the unexisting) traces of pencil-drawn straight lines while examining it. But he couldn't find them. And after a while the doorlock snapped, the door hit the rubber stopper and the motion sensor bleeped - Kei was back.

Ayer had just a second to make a decision. So he slipped Den's letter in his pocket, rushed through the window, jumped on the sill and disappeared.

"I want to forget."
---

Ayer was standing on his desk and the only thing on it were the five sheets of paper, which were inside the envelope  he stole from Kei's room. He was inspecting them very carefully, but he was not happy. In fact this was one of the rare moments when he wished he thought more before acting. Maybe it was the excitement or maybe it was just wishful thinking, but somehow he failed to realize that if a Japanese person conversed with another Japanese, they had no reason whatsoever to use a foreign language. Translating a letter from Japanese to English was not a hard task by itself, but it was next to impossible in the situation Ayer was in - he didn't think that his vague suspicions could justify breaching  privacy, so he couldn't just hand it to *anyone*, and the people whom he was working with weren't too fond of "off the table" operations. For a first time, Ayer realized how dependent he had become of the people and resources which he used in the last several months. At the end he decided that he would contact the Scotland Yard and hope for the best. 

"Listen Vince, don't ask me how but I think I aquired the letters that Den Lee sent to her sister before she died. The problem is that-"

"Cadman report to the Scotland Yard headquaters immediately."

"Why what happened?"

"I think you can deduce it! Kei had filed a complaint for breaking and entering. The Detective had scanned the files and guess what it saw. The penalty is one month in the jail for minor offences."

"OK, can we settle that when all this is over."

"There is no 'all this', Cadman." Vince was doing his best not to show any emotions. "And there is no way to postpone your penalty - once a conviction has been issued, then neither I nor anyone else can modify it." Vince made a long pause as if he had something on his mind but wasn't sure whether he should say it. "You have 24 hours," he said instead.

---

Ayer did not know what he could do or whether he had a choice at all, but the one thing certain was that he had to talk to his colleagues at the Yard. The following morning he went to visit them. He prepared his luggage in a backpack in case they took him away and went to check with his landlord Mrs Johnson and tell her what happened: "Listen, I might dissapear for some time. I don't want to be a burden, if I am not back I will be OK if you can throw away the most part of my stuff and get a new tenant."

"Nevermind your stuff." she replied, "Where the heck are you going?"

"Let's say that I started a job which I am not sure how would I finish," he smiled.

"Ah, as unsertain about himself as always," she reached out and touched his cheek, "in your job as well as your love life."

"I have no reason to be sertain about myself," Ayer said.

"Have I told you enough times that critics are the most unhappy people on Earth?" she asked and then became serious: "Can I help you, Ayer?"

"If you happen to know someone who speaks Japanese." Ayer said.

"But I do," she said. "*I* do."

---

She put on her spectacles and started reading of the screen of his phone, using her index finger to trace the long columns of hieroglyphics, while simultaneously checking some word definitions from her phone. She worked for fifteen minutes before uttering a translation of the first sentence: 

"I want to forget," she said. "This is what it says."  Then she spent around half an hour reading through the whole text and then and she left the letter on her desk: "So?" she said, "What do you need to know?"

Ayer wanted to respond but coundn't think of what exactly to ask her.

"This is a letter." Linda started. "The author talks about herself a lot. Kinda like a diary, but I cannot tell you anything without knowing more about the case."

"Is there something about crimes?" Ayer asked. The way his question sounded like Mrs Johnson laugh aand after seeing that she meant no harm, Ayer joined her.

"The only thing I know for sure is" she made a long pause "that you have to help that girl."

"I would help her-" Ayer said and then he almost told the widow about Den Lee's death, the thought that Linda's would almost certainly be scared by the though of it coming almost a second too late. "-but I don't know how," he finished to hide his error.

"You are a wise man... in some respects." Linda said. "Talk to her. You know that she has a problem, right?"

"I think that she might be involved in something..." Ayer said.

"Involved in something?" She bursted into laughter for a moment and the next one she was more serious than ever: "Sweety, from what I read, I would be surprised if the author of this letter can go to the store and fix a meal for herself. Not to mention some more complex activities."

"I don't understand," Ayer said. "What do is wrong with her?"

"Don't know how is it called now." Linda replied. "In my days we called it insanity."

---

Ayer recognized Kei right away, although she had turned her back on him. Her looks were again flawless and, as the last time. She sat alone in a crowded bar without paying much attention to her surroundings. He sat next to her and touched her shoulder. She turned to him and stared at him with her eyes just a few sentimeters away from his. Some people had such eyes that staring at them feelt like he was staring directly into their soul - Kei's eyes left in him the impression that he is looking into a dark and endless void.

"What do you want, Mr Cadman?" She asked.

"I wanted to give you this," he took the letter from the pocket of his coat and put in in the table.

"You don't want your colleagues to find it in your possesion?" she asked.

"No, I want to apologise."

"You broke into my apartment." she said without touching the letter, "you went through my belongings and stole some of them. And now you return it and you expect me to be nice to you?"

"Negative. I don't expect that from you," Ayer turned to her and tried to smile, "Just take it," Kei slowly reached out for it and slid it to an area of the table that was close to her. "Now, if you would be willing to forget my behaviour from our last meeting, I want to ask you something: How did it all happened?"

"I want to ask you something too," Kei said, "Who gives you the right to get your nose in my personal life? And I mean that literary - your colleagues told me that what you did was illegal."

"Breaking and entering is illegal in every country that has laws in the first place." Ayer smiled.

"And why do you keep bothering me?"

"OK, the reason is that I was mistaken when it comes to you. And this does not happen to me very often, actually rarely. And for this reason I am very keen to learn your story."

"Your curiosity is your problem," she continued, "Thank you for returning this, but-"

"There isn't any reason to hide it you know?" Ayer continued. 

"I didn't hide anything. I told her that she-"

"Yes and you were marvelous in your ability to deceive. And also very experienced, if I may say so. You even deceived me, before I could figured it out."

"Because you are such a capable investigator?"

"Because I am in a very similar position in some respects." Ayer said. "That is the truth."

"What?" In spite of her makeup and her constant mannerisms, at that moment Kei looked even younger than she actually was. "What are you talking about? What do you want from me?"

"I just want to know. No, scratch that - I want *you* to tell me?"

"What was this bullshit about you being in similar position?"

"Why aren't your parents with you?"

"I don't know, why did they throw her out of our house? And did not allow me to speak to her? How can you even think that-"While she was speaking, Ayer was mesmerised by her face, seeing it changing, becoming more youthful, more expressive and more characteristic of her as emotions were making it turn red. "Alright, you know, I will tell you the *whole* damn thing. Just promise that you would listen and walk away. So firstly, I have no idea how you could think that my sister would involve herself in some petty crimes. Secondly..."

She made a long pause and continued speaking in a very different tone.

Den’s Story
---

"From ever since we were little we did not resemble the other kids. Maybe because we were interested in Europe, and in particular the fairy tale aspect of it, that you Europeans often miss. As we grew older we saw the places that we envisioned slowly disappearing. The problem has been there ever since I can remember. As everyone else, I was a little appauled by her hideous features. I remember thinking that I surely was ugly too, being related to her. My condition, however, lasted only until I started going outside of the house, and her's only worsened with that."

"Maybe you should start from the beginning. You are saying your sister were ugly how, physically?" Ayer asked.

"Physically, of course!"

"So, she is ugly, how?" Ayer asked. Like her nose is too big or...

"Please, I am sure that even with your race being different she does not seem attractive to you. You don't need to pretend. Although it would have probably helped under certain circumstances," she continued talking and Ayer felt too uncomfortable to interrupt her again.

"Maybe the issue was that she was like that always, you know? Most people get broken at some point of their lives but her was nothing but. Started with overhearing witty remarks from our relatives. Continued with our peers in the kindergarden, our parent's lack of attention, and the dismissal of her ambitions, even when they did not have anything to do with looks, which started out subtle, but gradually became as explicit as it can be without breaking the good tone. Being the only one who saw that, I could have said something that would make her feel better, but I dindn't. I couldn't."

"Why?"

"I was afraid I would make my parents mad," Kei said. "Perhaps I should mention that they were idolising me with the same speed that they were demonising my sister. They viewed me as their compensation for having to take care of her, and as such, I had to be her antipode in every respect: because she was ugly, I had to be beautiful. Because she had no friends, I had to be social. Because she was sad, having to cope with all this, I had to be happy."

At that point Ayer was hardly listening. He still could not believe that this all conflict really existed. He wanted to shout: "But you look the same as her, I thought that you *were* her the first time I saw you, eventhough I knew that she was dead, how can all of that be?" 

"The more rejected she was, the more detached from her I became." Kei continued, not caring of his bafflement. Seeing how her life unfolded and all of the negative reactions that she provoked in my parents made me want to be as different from her as I possibly could. And the only way to verify that unlike her I was worth something was to constantly seek for my parent's approval. This was all that I ever did."

"And did that work?"

"I don't know if this question part of your investigation game?" Kei said "But if it is, you can congratulate yourself - I *still* feelt worthless. But it was (and you probably figured this one as well), little in comparison to how worthless I am feeling now. I feel like I can crush my life and trash it, like a useless piece of paper.

"Right. Because you felt compassion. You weren't so opaque as your family you didn't feel content with taking any part of the dehumanization of another human being because it felt as a dehumanization of yourself!"

Kei looked at him at first puzzled.

"Oh, please, I agreed to talk to you so I can help you, not hear your pretending to care."

"Actually you got it the other way around - it was when I expressed interest in your case that I was being dishonest, as I am entirely convinced that you are correct in asserting that Den Lee killed herself, and I was convinced of it ever since I found her letters. I actually came here because I want to hear more from you. But I am interrupting you, am I not? I believe that you were talking about your sense of worth.

Kei stared at him again, as if she was trying to see his thoughs through his skull and then, for a moment as short that Ayer could miss it by blinking, a smile flickered in her eyes.

"You know what was the most unusual?"

"Do tell me about it?"

"When we were little, we used to go to bed together and talk until we fall asleep. And as soon as we turned off the lights, all these differences suddenly became superficial. We would discuss everything without any form of taboo and would jump from one topic to another, sometimes the two being totally unrelated, without ever losing context. Aged nine, I felt like it was the first time that I was seeing a being that was the same species as myself. But as we grew older and they moved us to separate rooms, although completely unjustified, the fear that being close to her would make me unhappy became stronger. We would still talk and be friendly with each other but the connection between us soon became weak enough for it to be replaced by other, more novel stuff and once it was lost, we could not be together again, despite both mine and her best attempts. The difference between the way we handled the situation being that I quickly moved on, and with her the bullying and lack of support were already transferring into psychological issues and she couldn't.

"You are sorry that you left her?"

"No, we were still best friends, even after that. Best and only friends."

"So you did not persist your social lifestyle?"

"I did, and I still do, as a matter of fact, however I don't consider the people that I go out with my friends, I merely use them to satisfy my sexual desires."

"Anyway, when I became a teenager I started going out with people while my sister was constantly in her room drawing. She did it all the time, which was strange when you think about it, as she wasn't so interested in art in general and she didn't seem to be very ambitious about it either. She wasn't, as you would have expected from someone who is unpopular, trying to prove to everyone that she is better than them. I think that she did it just to direct her negative emotions somewhere, apparently that worked for her very sucessfully. When she was depressed, she could knock off 10-20 pieces and per houe and and come up happy again. There were times when we would dump some of them in the trash, simply because there was nothing else that we could do with them. People were actually alligning so they can take them." Den smiled.

"So how did she got here?"

"I probably know less than you do about that, but she must have used the help of professionals - people who help you disappear without a trace. Once you do that you are a nobody, but you are free to live the rest of your life however you like."

"But she didn't break her ties with you?"

"A month later I received what was supposed to be her farewell letter. I responded to it. Soon another one followed. It looked like it was written by a different version of her - like someone who spent his life under different sircumstances. She told me, among other things that she was selling her art at a Sunday market somewhere around her house. It looked like she was feeling fulfilled and financially secured, although she'd never explicitly mentioned it. Our connection grew even deeper than it was before we lived together. I even helped her set up an online store, for her to sell her stuff." She became silent.

"And then?"

"And then she got worse again." Below the thick layer of makeup, Kei's face showed the full spectrum of human emotion, as if Ayer was watching a timelapse of everything that she went through for the last few years. "It all started, I think when people began opening for her stuff. She generated so much interest, that she couldn't handle it. She wasn't ready to open for the world."

"What about the black dolls, the "women in black" as she called them right before ending her life. Do you know about them?"

"Why do you care?"

Ayer could easily could have answered that in any other situation, but that moment the question almost paralised him. "Why do you care, really," he heard Kei's voice in his head, "when it is obvious that you are wrong not only when it comes to me and my sister, but in your whole perception of our world. Why do you care, when it is obvious that grasping the circumstances under which we lived is way above your abilities. Is it because when you feel you understand it, it somehow makes you less afraid? Or is it the case of one lost soul, trying desperatly to find another one?" 

Ayer shook his head and stared at Kei. She was smiling at him.

"I am sorry about everything that I caused you," he said.

"No need, to apologise, Ayer, quite the opposite. You did something that noone else has ever done for me."

"Storming your apartment to steal some personal stuff from you?"

"You tried to understand me. Noone has ever done that."

"The only reason why I don't feel completely content tonight is that I am alone in sharing myself. So tell me this - I have been hiding my emotional state since I was six. I devised a whole new persona so as for my publicly exposed feelings not to interfiere with my real ones. And yet, you knew what I was doing right from the start. How do you knew that. Or rather, *why* do you know it?"

"The secret is that there is no secret." Ayer smiled.

"I don't know how can a person who knows so much about other people, can know so little about himself," Kei said and smiled, but Ayer did not respond to her smile - he shrugged his shoulders and disappeared in the dark.

Ayer rushed to the station and took the train to Scotland Yard, feeling overwhelmed. He hoped into the train and spent the next ten minutes not thinking of absolutely anything.
