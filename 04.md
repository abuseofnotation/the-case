The Unexpected Withness

Status Report
---

Vince coudn't find Ayer anywhere in the building until he learned that he was, as some of his colleagues were kind enough to tell him, probably down the hallway at the abandoned part of the building, standing up facing the windows. It was there where, according to them, he had spent most of his free time. 

He remembered the place they were talking about. It was near an area of the building remained deserted after the layoffs. While approaching it, Vince though whether it is appropriate of him to bother Ayer this way - he hadn't talked to him in almost a month, and the only reason why he knew where he was was his colleagues' unwanting, or inability, to shut their months. And when he saw Ayer, he also didn't look like he wanted to speak to somebody. Out of his many emotionless expression which Vince had learned to differentiate in the course of the last several months, this one was particularily uninviting. Vince approached him and greeted him formally. Ayer turned his head to him and scanned him from head to toe.

"Hi," he said, his tone indicated that he was doing it merely to obey the social conventions, without putting any emotion, good or bad.

"Cadman, what are you doing here?" Vince said, obeying social conventions of his own.

Ayer did not say anything at first. At the end, he muttered something but it was far from the level of coherence to which Vince was used to from him.

"Don't get me wrong I always thought that this halway was pretty nice place." Vince continued "- it is just that it don't _go_ anywhere, you know?

"My room also doesn't go anywhere."

"Yeah but... What's happenining, Ayer?" Vince was confused so he thought that being honest is the best way to attack the situation, "Your manners, your tone... It is almost as you had forgotten whom are you speeking to."

"You think you don't know who you are why are you here?" Ayer stared at him. "You are my boss. You came to me because it's been three months since I started and you must go and talk to be about how this organizations values me et cetera. You pretend to be my friend, although you'd probably prefer to be my parent if you got to pick. And you like me, and feel bad about it. Have I made a mistake so far?"

"Can we now focus on you?" Vince said, but Ayer didn't quit:

"You are married and have two kids from a woman you are friends with, but towards whom you don't feel passionate about. You pretend that you don't need passion, but in fact you do. That is why you need to make up for your live's dullness by flirting with your partner in a way that's, if I may say so, rather clumsy."

"OK, enough!" Vince said. "You got everything correctly. You win. You are good. One of the best in fact, not that this is such a big deal, but you are. But still I am your boss. And now you have to come with me."

---

"So, people say nice things about your work." Vince started, once they sitted themselves in the canteen."

"I don't understand. I did nothing. Den's file is almost empty." Ayer replied.

"Are you kidding? You must have solved ten cases since you got here. And a hundred more, which were solved by the Detective using your ideas. Like we care about Den Lee."

"The Japanese have no records about this person ever existing." Ayer continued. "She was running away from something. I don't have any idea what. But I believe she is the key to finding out what who is behind the odd crimes."

"What? Odd crimes? You still search for that one person who is responsible for all of them?"

"There must be some reason for all this which is happening."

"Maybe yes, maybe no." Vince said, "In any case, why do you bother with it? We capture all perpetrators with zero issues, you do a pretty good job at solving the deviant cases, and after the boffins implement some of the tactics you use into the Detective, it starts tracking similar cases by itself. 

"...by itself." Ayer repeated.

"Yes, by itself." Vince said. "Look, I said it earlier, you are correct - you being an employee of the month is not important. You know what is important though? That if today you submit a patch to the Detective's alghorithm, it will always be there. As long as the infrastructure is there it will always prevent a similar crimes from happening. In effect, we might say that you created an antidode for a given class of crimes. Don't you find this amazing? If not, consider this: If we count the number of solved cases, which is for me the only objective metric, you are probably the most sucessfull investigator ever!" 

Vince raised his voice, trying to grab Ayer's attention, but all he got was a raised eyebrow.

"All I do is to make up and test numerous weird and somewhat absurd ideas, until one of them turns out to be correct in, say, ten percent of the cases. I don't think that this practice is in any way as useful as you present it to be, neither do I think that the numbers are important."

"Weird? Absurd? Nobody else in the whole building could come up with something close to what you do. But I am beggining to think that there is no way for me to make you happy. But you didn't forget, right? We are on a mission..."

"Yeah, on a mission to end crime." Ayer said.

"You are coming tonight, right?" Vince said.

"Are you?"

"I have this meeting early the next day, but I will definitely come by to see you."

Drunk
---

The party was organized in a rather simple and ad-hoc way. After the working hours had ended all employees were invited to the big conference room, which looked exactly like any other day, except that the chairs were placed next to the walls and some music could be heard from the conference speakers. Vince and the rest of the management (excluding Jane) came for around 10-15 minutes to congratulate Ayer and his team, and they were quick to leave. After that someone delivered pizzas and several kegs of beer which some of Ayer's colleagues attacked immediately. The last time Ayer had drunk alcohol was long time ago but then he decided to pop a few bottles and to indulge in some technical conversations with them. 

"You know, I read they started working of some kind of global database, containing the faces of all people in the world."

"It's about time." Ayer said. "You know how many emigrants from all over the world arrive?"

"No, but I know how to check." Johny replied.

"That was rhetorical." Chad said.

"No it wasn't." Ayer said, "Its about a thousand. 

"But almost no cases involving them." Pankill said, "Except that one that you had to solve originally, right Ayer." 

"Don't remind him about that one," Johny smiled but then he immediately became serious again: "Sorry Ayer, just trying to pull off some jokes here."

"I don't mind it." Ayer said. "Plus I will solve that case someday."

"I don't know about that one, but the one you solved today was rad."

The conversation continued for several hours and Ayer soon felt as relaxed as if he was with people whom he knew very well. Then a boy whom he didn't know at all came to their table and sit next to him. He turned to that boy and without being afraid that someone would notice he scanned his appearance as meticulously as he could.

"Ayer, don't you have any respect of the new colleague's privacy?" Chad yelled from across the room when he noticed Ayer's stare.

"What is 'privacy'?" John asked and everyone that weren't already laughing started doing so.

"Cover yourself!" Chad turned to the boy who was just seeing Ayer looking at him, "Cover yourself with something, or he will read your mind," 

He was almost sick with laughter as were everyone else in the room, except the boy, who looked rather perplexed.

"Don't mind that guy," Allie said. 

"I don't." The boy smiled. "I just don't know what is happening."

"Wait, I have an idea." Chad said."Ayer scan this person again and tell us the most embarrasing things you find out. 

"Come on, Chad." Allie said. "Won't you stop having fun on other people's expense!"

"Fun is not the only thing that he is having on other people's expense, I can tell you that" Johny said and started laughting at his own joke.

"Yeah, won't you do that thing for Chad, Ayer! Why don't you scan Chad and tell us what you find out!"

"I am not scanning anyone," Ayer said. "And I am not using my abilities to embarass people."

"Don't worry, I will take it." The boy said. "Seems interesting."

"Do it Ayer, but be nice, please." Pankill said.

"But not too nice." John added.

"No. Doing this would indicate that I don't take my abilities seriously. And I take them very seriously." 

"Come on, Ayer, you are always using your skills to show off." Chad said.

"That is different." 

"Or maybe you don't see anything you can share with us?"  continued.

"Maybe I don't."

"But do you?" That was the boy. "I want to know whether you are really as good as people claim you to be. And if you want, I won't tell anyone whether you are correct or not. It will be our secret."

"And we still get all the fun from watching you too, sounds like a plan" Johny said and all other people in the room expressed silent agreement to this idea. Their turned their heads to Ayer, almost simultaneously."

"Alright." Ayer said. "Let's begin. I think that your parent are divorced."

Everyone looked at what the boy would say in return, but he acted like he didn't even hear the remark."

"Because of the way their relationship ended you are still afraid to talk to women for fear that you will end up like them," The boy still said nothing.

"That, plus, you had a terrible acne when you were a teenager..." Ayer continued and pointed at a little scar on the boy's forehead, "Decided you will impress people with your brain, not with your looks, but there were people who had the looks and were no less smarter than you... You hated people for being so shallow and you felt you are superior to most of them..." The boy was listening but from his expression he did not seem impressed.

"You masturbated about a hour ago," Ayer said suddenly, "I'd say it was in the toilet next to your office."

"Alright, now you are just making stuff up." Allie said, "Stop it, Ayer!"

"Yeah man, just admit defeat." Johny said. We won't embarras *you*."

Ayer took a closer look at the rest of his companions. They were surrounding him from all sides. They did not look disappointed, but quite the opposite. They were happy. He did what they wanted him to, not because he had to do it, but simply because he wanted to blend in. He was assimilated. It was then he realised that the boffins will never understand him the way he understood them. Not because they could not, but because they would not try. They liked him only because he was interesting. For them he was just a pretty persona, that they felt good having around. None of them attached any significance to the evenings that he/she spent with his/her colleagues, like the current one. For them all these times, all relationships that they have were nothing more than a way to distract themselves and to kill some time. And Ayer did not like to kill time. For some reason he always felt that he does not have enough of it.

Before leaving, he went to talk to the boy while noone else was listened, and asked him why he reacted so calmly to what he said and what part of his assertions were true.

"Well, actually all of them," the boy said. But what difference does that make?"

"Well, for me it does." Ayer said. "Sorry, just doing this job makes me feel awkward at times."

"I mean, if some damn alghorithm is as good as predicting human behaviour than I am, then does that mean that it is more human than me?"

"But Ayer, being human is not about predicting other people's behaviour. I mean, for me it is not about beheviour at all, just a matter of how you feel."

"Who knows how I feel?" Ayer responded.

---

While still slightly sad (and very drunk), Ayer found himself in his office where he came to pick up his jacket. He turned to the wall where he transferred all evidence from his home office. Articles about disapearing people. In Japan there was (or perhaps "there wasn't" Ayer thought and tried to smile like he was still with the boffins) around 100 000 of them every year, mostly out of shame of personal failures. Not clear how many left the country, but searching for Den Lee's identity was next to impossible. He turned to the other wall, where he kept some pictures of Den Lee's dolls. Looking at them reminded him of the last hand-made object that he owned - it was a teacup, rather clumsily made, which he had from year three to around seven. The cup was made from porcelain and was shaped like a figure of fat person, with the person's hands acting like handles for the cup. He remembered how he used to enjoy drinking his milk from that cup before his mother stopped using it in favour of big tea set with identical cups for everyone. The memory dispersed. He looked at Den Lee's dolls again and thought that something so unnatural as them just *had* to be connected, either directly or indirectly, to her case. On his computer he saw the last query that he was working on. He started reading it, but he was appauled by the dumb heuristics that he was using - it now seemed to him that all he did was to consume the ideas and features that OSCAR had, rather than produce original content. "And to think that this shit can actually work?" he thought, "Imagine if some true inspiration was employed."

Then he sit over his chair and he started typing. What he created was not cheap to run, nor was it pretty in the sense in which boffins used that word when they spoke about code. But it was correct. And when he ran it, it returned exactly one result.

Vince entered Jane's office without knocking and sat on her couch.

"That kid again..." Vince said. "Now using his colleague's computers to run some queries."

"They complained?"

"No, they were stone drunk. Probably still are, for that matter," Vince tried to remember whether the boffins were at work that morning. "Look, I know what are you going to say but "No harm done" is not enough for me. If we don't put him on his spot now, there will be no way to control him!

"Then go and do it. Why are you coming here?"

"Jane..."

"Listen, we are in a gigantic mess, that we haven't even begin to untangle. Our most valuable resource has got his resignation in his pocket since day one. And your biggest issue is how to *control* people? And as King Lear's jester says-"

"OK, I get it. I will keep my mouth shut."

"I am afraid sometimes merely doing nothing is not enough." Jane said. "You know what's Ayer's problem? That the Yard does not give him anything. Like for example, have you actually seen what he did on those computers?" 

"Something very costly. I am not good at computer programming."

"Well," Jane said, "it is about the case of Den Lee. And is near damn brilliant. He basically goes through half of Japans population and it the end her discovers who she was."

"You said this case is bogus."

"I did. But I might be wrong. And even if I am not, would it hurt for him to check? You need to keep employees happy. Give him something that he will like. Help him with that case of his."

Kei
---

He arrived at a small room, which resembled a storehouse. There were two chairs. one of them was occupied by Vince and on the other sat a girl which looked exactly like Den Lee. The girl stood up before Ayer. She made a deep long bow and  Ayer made a clumsy attempt to copy her jesture.

"And you?" he started. "Actually-"

"I am her sister," She replied in perfect English.  
She sat upright, with her toes touching the floor with a posture that made her look like she was about to attack him. Both her toes and her nails were painted with dark nail polish - perhaps to hide signs of biting, but the layer was so thick that he couldn't be sure. She looked like she was about twenty, but she was dressed and made up as a much older woman. The level of sophistication of her wardrobe was unlike what he had seen by people who had recently started living alone, which tended to look a lot more liberated. Perhaps this was a way for her to show character or exactly the opposite - to hide her character from him. If the latter was true, she was doing a perfect job - the amount traits she managed to hide from him was astounding - this was probably the smallest he'd ever known for a living person in a long while. He looked at her and smiled, while trying to relax himself with the fact that it was probably her race that prevented him from seeing a clearer picture of her.

"Mrs Kei Lee is in the city for a few months," Vince entered the conversation, "I contacted her unofficially, after I read the new findings regarding her sister's case and I invited her to talk about your theory."

"I won't going to ask you why didn't you notified me.

Ayer felt like he had to speak althogh the information he had wasn't nearly enough for him to feel confident. With his eyes closed, he started what would turn out to be one of the hardest (and least successful) hearings in his career:

"So firstly I am sorry for your sister," he turned to the girl, "I don't know how it feels to lose a close one, so I am not going to say that I sympathise, but nevertheless take my deepest condolences."

Kei nodded but did not say anything.

"It is particularily unfortunate to see such thing happening to a tallented person like your sister.

"Oh please," She smiled but her eyes did not move an inch, "by now you've probably figured that the crafts were just a hobby for her."

"Alright, what would you consider her *job* then?"

"She did not do anything in particular. She was overcoming some emotional problems, which I would prefer not to discuss."

"Are you positive about the 'nothing' part?"

"I am sure, we spoke often," Kei replied, "We were sending each other letters."

"I don't understand, Vince said. We trace all internet activity, there were zero e-mails sent from her accounts."

"Not e-mails. We were sending each other paper letters," Kei said, "for as long as I remember."

"And where are these letters? Do you have copies?"

"No, I don't have them, they are gone." She said and Vince had a hard time digesting the fact that she was correct - there were absolutely no way to know what information Den had shared with Kei nor with anyone else, for that matter, "but what we discussed in those letters was nothing... material. I doubt that their content would interest you."

"Were you aware of your sister's whereabouts after she ran away?"

"Of course I was," She said, "running away is not always about leaving."

"And was anyone else aware of them?"

"I believe not."

"I think you realize that the more details you share, the more likely it is for us to find out what had happened," Ayer said.

"But I know what happened," the girl said.

"And you are sure?"

"Yes," she lowered her head and for the first time she looked her age, "She had serious issues."

"Serious enough for her to jump out of the window?" Ayer said.

"Like I said I prefer not to discuss this," She remained calm and made Ayer regret his blunt remark.

"What do you make of the call." Ayer asked.

"Nothing," Kei said. "I don't know why she did that."

"You think that someone does?"

"Alright, what do you want me to say," she laid her head on her elbows, written on her face was an emotion that he could not decode, "What response to you hope to get?"

"I want to know the truth." Ayer said.

"Well, you alredy do know the truth. I already told it to you."

"Look, I understand that you don't believe me, and quite frankly I think that you do not care too much about how exactly did your sister die. But before us lays a question, that question surely has an answer and I think it will be good to find it.

"All this is true," Kei said, "however-"

---

As Vince was walking Kei to the door, Ayer realized that she player him out. Her responses were always circumventing his questions, she made a very good use of her position and didn't even give him a chance to ask her some of the things he had in mind like the disapearance of the dolls from her apartment. But maybe she secured herself a bit too much. Because now Ayer was certain that this girl was hiding something. He was sure of this like he was sure that she lied about not having the letters her sister wrote.

Ayer wondered whether there is a point to discuss this with Vince at all. Vince's job was simple - to make sure all procedures were followed properly. In fact it was so simple, that knowing a thing or two about them, Ayer could almost construct the whole dialog that they were about to exchange: "You had your shot, " he'd say, "There are no grounds whatsoever for engaging Kei in any other way. No I won't make an exception. I guess you don't realize that I am already making one by letting you speak to her." "What suspicion? On what grounds?" "Just because she didn't think your ideas were plausible does not make her suspicious." 

Ayer looked at his profile as he was exiting the room and quckly realized that he will never be capable of arguing with this person. He could not argue with someone who had never entered the realm of the abstract. Couldn't argue with someone, who, late-night when he was about to go to bed, he didn't even consider fully human.

Ayer focused at the window, which was facing the exit of the building.
