Away

Lost
---

Ayer woke up from a sunbeam, coming from a rounded-corner window. He turned his head away from the light, but soon he had no choice but to open his eyes, noting that he had fallen asleep in the train and that he was probably many miles away from the city. At first he didn't attach any emotions to that fact - actually he barely remembered where he was going in the first place, but after several seconds, the serenity with which he woke up disappeared, and he felt threatened. He got up and tried to assure himself that everything was OK. His carriage was empty with the exception of three young men, about 20 years old, who were sitting at a coupe next to him and were speaking so loudly that he didn't know how he ever managed to sleep with them sitting next to him. He turned to the man closest to him and scaned him. And though he looked like an easy target he didn't see almost anything.

Ayer went through his appearance again but there was still nothing apparent. Who was this man? Or rather, was there any difference? Ayer picked another target and tried to scan him only to find that the answer was "No" - there were nothing special about the little-rounded boy and his companions which were standing half-seated half-lying, laughting at each other's jokes. His abilities had just halted. They were no more. He tried to regain some of his self-confidence, by examining the person next to him more closely. Aparently while doing so, he didn't stop staring at his neighbours, because soon one of them noticed him and shouted:

"What are *you* looking at?"

"Hey, don't be an asshole," another one of the men said at the first one "you are not in London, any more." The bloke is probably bored to death at this point and he is just in search of something to talk to, right mate?"

"Ayer nodded."

"Yeah, it sucks travelling alone, right? I keep telling them this. My name is Charlie by the way, glad to meet you, the guys over there also are, they are just a little nervous as usual. Come sit with us if you want."

Ayer got up from his chair, shook hands with each of the men and presented himself with a fake name. Charlie asked him where he was from. He said he was from London and asked the men in return: "So, me I was born around 10 kilomenters from where we stand." Charlie started, "but I spent the last five years in London, also. Now I am bringing these two Londoners here to show them what is like being outside." 

Ayer did not need to scan him again to verify his words - he'd already noticed the confidence with which he spoke of the hills and mountains which were displayed before him and his friends, as well as the shyness with which he responded to some of their witty remarks, related to the life in the city. He'd seen his clothing style, which was nothing more than a replica of their's but viewed from a more down-to-earth, not to mention naive, perspective. He'd seen all of these signs, which meant that he hasn't lost his attentiveness, the issue apparently was that his brain was no longer willing to take the leap of faith required for it to see beyond what was presented before it.

He revisited the events from the previous day, and started realising what had happened to him - all of his mistakes in judging Kei must have shook his confidence up to the point where he stopped trusting his own judgement. He had screwed up everything. And the disappearance of his abilities was was his brain's way of telling him "Timeout - from now on we cannot be sure about anything."

He closed his eyes and tried to resume his inner monologue and regain the voice of confidence which had always kept him calm and in control:

"You see Watson, it is obvious from the way that this person is copying the clothing style of his aquaintances, that he is trying to fit in, rather unsuccessfully if I may add. Now, a blind man can see that they are Londoners, so the question is only where *he* is from."

He looked at the people next to him and he felt more scared.

"Well, that is not as obvious, but still, he looks like he knows his way around here, so I might make an educated guess that he is a local," he continued speaking but his confidence was disapearing.

---

Ayer resumed his discussion with the group, and tried to act as if nothing had happened, but that was not an easy task - being around people without knowing their wishes and intentions called upon a number of unanswered questions. And in Ayer's mind, a question without an answer spelled "Caution". It spelled "You are not safe anymore." Ayer took a few steps back an headed to the train door, which was opened at that moment.

"Hey, where the hell are you going?" Charlie asked.

"This is my stop," he responded. 

No sooner had he exited the train, when he realised the reason why his action caused so much bafflement - he had departed in the middle of nowhere. The stop where he had found himself consisted just of one little wooden shed with two benches stuck to it. It was surrounded from all sides with thick woods. A few meters from it, there was a trail - when he looked at it, Ayer felt like he could take it and walk all his life without meeting anybody. This illusion, however, lasted for no more than a few minutes, after which Ayer heard a loud noise, coming from the direction opposite to the one he came from - the train to London was coming. 

He stood next to the rails looking through its windows as it stopped, stood in one place and then started gaining speed again. His initial urge to hop on it was strong but he resisted it - he wouldn't go back to London before sorting this out. He *couldn't*. 


Abuse
---

His abilities didn't start emerging until he was as old as twelve. Still he had little memories of the time before he had them - mostly he had spent it trying to make sense of things as simple as a spoon, while circling around the two rooms which he was permitted to enter. All that he truly remembered from that time was a vague feeling of abuse. He didn't have any specific memories of it, it was just there in the background throughout most of his childhood. This was the environment where his abilities florished.

The first thing which he started observing was the change of behaviour of his nanny - once in every 28 days there was one day when she would put him to sleep around 12 minutes earlier than usual and would also deny him at least two things that she usually allowed him. He could guess when one of these days was coming from the way her lips were pointing downwards, when she was speaking (he had already learned to look at the person's mouth for indications of his behaviour). About once every week (but at different day each week) she would do the exact opposite - she would allow him to do everything that he pleased. These days her lips were pointing upward. Sometimes she acted in different ways than those two but soon he discovered that almost all of them were described in a little book which he found accidentally - "The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals". Based on their origin, which was described in the same book, he was also able to influence them by changing his behaviour. Not long after he started doing that, she and his parents started allowing him to go out and to do more things. With his new found knowledge, he concluded that it made them *happy*.

When they sent him to school it was much easier for him to integrate - by that time he had become an expert in reading emotions, and there everybody had them and everybody were influenced by them for each and every thing that they did. He got along quite well with his classmates and all of this made everyone around him very happy. His parents had started giving him missions which they wanted him to accomplish, like have a better grades and befriending specific people. They were very happy when he did well in these missions, and so was his doctor. But when he didn't, or when he wouldn't want to put effort in accomplishing them, all of them would make them mad which was bad, as they (more specifically his doctor) held the key to his freedom. 

But gradually their feelings had started shifting more and more in the negative spectre. He immediately recognised both the tendency itself, and its cause - he had started reading things that they didn't want him to read. His abilities had surpassed the level which was desirable and he was picking up not only their personas, but was going deep into their inner selves. And they were rejecting him. But he had continued - the only way for him to establish contacts with other people, and really the only thing he could do when he was around them was to give voice to their inner selves. And the more they tried to prevent him from doing that, the more motivated he was to go there and find out why. But he never did. Soon he was back in his tiny little baloon, except neither he nor his parents wanted him out. They were now his enemies. And his abilities - the weapon which he used to keep them away. He still remembered how this paradox tore his childish brain - they desired to be understod and they were appauled when he finally managed to do it fully. And he never got the freedom he promised until he ran away.

What had happened after that? He had never really asked himself this question. He never saw himself as a person with a disability, nor one who was abused. He preferred to tell himself and everyone else the story how he just *liked* the detective work per se, rather than as a way to protect and establish himself. In retrospect, it looked like he had just become one of those people - the ones which fabricate complex and intricate personas in order to draw the other's attention away from their true self. And he had succeeded to do it. Untill he'd met a person who could read him in the same way as he read everyone else.

Figuring all that out made him smile. He took the trail which he'd saw before and started walking through the mountains, feeling himself lighter and lighter with every step. 

Interruption
---

Vince and Jane dialed Ayer's number from the computer so they both could see the image. After a few seconds they saw a boy which they could hardly recognise. Ayer really looked like a child and the resemblance was not only methaphorical - he wore his shirt dirty and unbuttoned, he walked as he spoke, and his expression which was usually hard to read was now primal in its display of determination and satisfaction.

A few years back, Jane had spoken with her friends about Ayer's inability to show emotions. She firstly described it as a joke, but one of them took the description very serious and started analysing it.

"Maybe he is fearful," she started. "That is usually it, right?"

"But does he do it in a condescending manner? Like, 'You are not good enough to revoke emotions in me.'"

"I'd say a little of the two, although more of the first one. He cried that one time, remember?"

"But that does not fit in. A master of his craft, a savant so to say and *he* has impostor sindrome..."

"Maybe he is really an impostor, just in a different way."

Jane make a note to call her and greet her for once again producing abstract phrases such as this one, which were later turning out to be correct in a most peculiar way.

"Hello, Ayer," Vince who insisted that he should do the talking said.

"Hi," the boy said without stopping and without looking at the screen.

"So, before you say anything, I'd like to tell you a few things myself. Firstly, about this so called crime of yours - you should know that I talked to Kei personally and can assure you she has no interest in pursuing her allegations any further. And between you and me, even if she did I'd still find a way to get you out. Because, Ayer, you were correct. And I don't know how I haven't saw it earlier." Vince waited for Ayer to react but he did nothing, as if he wasn't listening at all. "Surely you remember what you said right? About all crimes being related to one another."

"But Den Lee *did* kill herself," Ayer said.

"Yes, she really did that. I am glad that we are on the same page. But the so called, odd crimes, the fact that they are organised centrally, in short everything else that you said is true. And now when we too are aware of that, together we could concentrate on finding the root cause of all that."

"I am not coming back." Ayer said.

"Why?"

"We both know that I am not the person you need. You need synchronisation, teamwork, standards - all of which things which I am not very good at."

"Is that the real reason?" Vince said.

"Ayer, you don't need to pretend," Jane added, "We *know* the truth now. We know who you really are."

"Or *were*, if you insist." Vince said after a second. 

"Stop it," Jane said, "allow him to process it."

Ayer took his phone, threw it in a nearby river and continued on his way forward.

---

He had already forgotten which way was for the train station but that did not bother him - near him there was a clean mountain spring, so the water was a non-issue, and he cout go for 2-3 days without food. He looked at the sun in order to see when it will set and deduced that he had about an hour to find a place to sleep. 

He began wondering what was he to do the other day. And the day after, but he did not really want to *think* about it - the thoughts and images which he previously called his life were still in his head. He didn't want to make another decision until they dissapeared completely. And still it was clear to him that he wouldn't spend the rest of his life doing nothing. He had to find something to keep him occupied. Even if he wasn't *good* in it, even if he did not earn much money (over the course of the last years he had made enough of it). All he had to do is like it. He could be a violinist perhaps? Although that sounded too serious, at least in the eyes of certain people it did.

His mind visualised a list of five or six occupations that he could do, mostly it was ones one typically sees in the children's books, but the more he examined them, them more discouraged he felt as if those were just some new roles which he needed to play against his will and which were to be as unfit for him as the one he played previously. Comparing them with what he had experienced before, they seemed darker and uniniviting. But that, as he came to realise, was normal - he was 26 years old, but his mind contained more information that most people manage to gather throughout most of their lives, most of it was very very specific. Information about characters, motives, evidence. And about places - if he had time, he could probably rebuild the whole city in which he lived in, without any of its few million habitats finding the difference. The contrast between the richness and completeness of his memories and the current emptiness made him feel like not only his persona, but his ego was going away. 
He went through the list of future occupations like a poker player going through his cards. His speculative abilities made him feel like he could visualise how he will spend his life if he went with each of them. As if all he needed to do is ask himself, say, "How would I feel if I decide to have a family?" and he could already see the double bed. He saw his wife decorating the living room, he could  feel the thoughts running through his head when he was looking after his child. He could see everything, and everything seemed perfect. There was, however one problem - he did not feel any enthusiasm, about doing any of these things. He wasn't feeling enthusiastic about his freedon. And without enthusiasm (he realized that just then) the sparks of light which came from good experiences would never be enough to compensate for the eternal darkness which everything consisted of.

And then just as he felt that there isn't a right or even a semi-right thing that he could do, a thought crossed his mind that was so novel and unexpected that it sounded like it was coming from another person:

"How do you like your old life back. How do you like to be a detective?"

"But may abilities may have gone for good," he thought to himself but the voice didn't stop.

"So what? It is not like most people have any abilities to begin with. If you will be choosing a life, it makes much sense to choose a life which you know well, and your own life is a good option."

"But that life it wasn't really my own."

"Yeah, but it is the closest you have. Plus you know full well it's as good as any other."

"Look, there is no value in reinventing your persona to start a new and end up in the same old situation. The only way for a life to be your own is for you to keep making it your own."

---

Vince watched as the telephone emmitting the signal he was seeing on the screen fled throuth the air, without making a sound. The transmission finished with a loud splash, after which, the speakers were also silent. Jane got up and began stretching her arms, but Vince still stood motionless like a person who finally finds his carkeys only to discover a second later that his vehicle is stollen.

"You happy?" Vince said finally.

"What?" Jane asked and positioned herself between him and the blank screen.

"All you do is encourage him. So this is why I am asking you if you are happy... Are. You."

Vince couldn't finish his sentence, as Jane interrupted him with a strong kick in his chest, which caused him to fall back in his chair. He rolled on the floor once or twice, holding his belly and got up on his knees. "Why?" He said and then stared at her with amazement, expecting to see distress or anger on her face, but the only emotion he could read was a vague awkwardness.

"Didn't you once say that I should hit you if you say such stuff?" She said. 

"What?"

"Nevermind, must have been someone else."

"What? What stuff?" Vince was still trying to take a breath.

"Intolerant, ignorant... Treating people as if you own them."

"But he-"

"What he did was completely normal given the things that he has been through and the way you reacted. If you have really looked into what-"

"What the hell do you mean, the way *I* reacted. I saw the files, alright.  So what if he had some mental problems when he was a kid? He still has no right to lie to us. Plus he resolved those when he was 7."

"Or rather this was when they began. If you were aware with his condition you'd know that there was no cure for it, neither there was a way for him to magically turn into a normal dumb kid. He had to *learn* how to act like one. All of the things that we do naturally, he had to learn. Why do you think that he is so good at reading people? Because he had to *study* most of the things that we say and do, without paying attention to them, so he can replicate them."

"Imagine being in its place," she continued, "Where the only way for you to communicate with people is to pretend you are someone else."

"You are making it sound so dramatic. Nobody is born as a perfect cog in society's machine. The big difference is not in how hard it is for you to comply, but how *willing* are you to do so. Some of us just *choose* not to complain and to make an extra effort to around our weaknesses without making a fuss about."

"You are not a non-conformist, Vince!" Jane said. "And it would be good if you *were* in the habit of making an extra effort, you would probably read the hard copy of Ayer's archives, not just the digital summary!"

---

Fifteen minutes before the end of his workday, Vince took one of the big notebooks which were delivered in his office a few days ago and opened it with the intention of going through so to convince himself that he hadn't missed anything. He skimmed through the begginning rather quickly, reading the first sentence of each (rather long) paragraph, complimenting himself for how closely he followed the thoughts of the author and the contents of the notebooks (although that was the first time he was opening them). This all changed when he got to the first appendix - a page which was structured like a dialogue between people:

"Hello."

"Hello."


"Hi."

"Hi Ayer."


"Morning, Cadman."

"Hi Sir.


"Ayer, how are you?"

"Pretty good, you?

"After seeing you, better!"

"Good to hear."

The last line was marked with a red question mark.

Vince turned to the next page.

---

"Ayer, are you ready for the next round of the olympics?"

"Yes Sir."

"Are you excited about it?"

"No." This line was also marked red.

"And why is that Ayer?"

"Because I am almost certain I will be better than everyone, except Phillip, of course."

"You shouldn't be so confident in yourself, Ayer."

This was where the document ended. Vince left it and picked up another one.

---

"Do you like me, Ayer?"

"I like all girls."

"Yes, but do you like me *more* than others, right?"

"I like all girls."

"Then why are you buying me sweets?"

"Because I wanted to make you happy. Because I know that you are *not* happy."

"But everyone else likes me!"

---

"Hi sir."

"Ayer, I want to talk to you. I saw that you submitted an empty sheet at the olympics. Why? I guess it wasn't so easy after all, was it?" 

"It was, I *could* solve all the tasks, I did not do it. Did not feel like it."

"And don't you like other people to *know* that you can solve them? Your classmates for example?"

"Is this about my public image?"

---

"First question: do you know why are you here? Do you know why are you at the principle's office?"

"No."

"Quit it, boy. Vanessa came to me crying today and told me that you hit her."

"I did not hit her."

"But you don't seem very surprised by her accusations."

"I am not. She is a manipulative person. She likes me and she wants me to be her boyfriend.  But I don't. This is the reason why she was crying."

"So you are saying she is doing this just to hurt you?"

"No, she just cannot handle negative feedback in any other way than the one you observe now. "

"What makes you think that I would believe this ridiculous story?"

"Nothing. I know that you wouldn't. Because you did not believe any of the other stories. Because you don't know Jessica. Because you think I am crazy. Does not matter which one."

"Now, Ayer, I did not say you are crazy."

"Even though this has happenend before you wouldn't believe me. Even though you have every second of my life written down, and can check what I said and did at any time, you still wouldn't believe me."

"I don't know what you are talking about. That thing on your wrist, its for the doctors only. Noone but they can see what's in there."

Vince started turning the pages faster, reading through all conversations which Ayer ever held with anyone. From first glance it looked like his whole persona was recorded there, at least that would be the case had it been anyone else who was wearing that bracelet. But upon going further, Vince came to the conclusion that there actually wasn't anything there about him that he could learn from these books - at least there wasn't anything more truthful than his made-up stories about how solving crimes was a passion of his and how he went to the Asian district to pursue it. All was an intricately-built mythology, superficially based on facts but extremely deceiving at every important level.  

Vince continued to skim through the pages until a differently-formatted document caught his attention.

---

"12-th of October. Patient name: Ayer Cadman. You can begin."


"OK, what do you want me to say?"

"I don't know, how is it going?"

"You are supposed to know the answer to that question.

"I do, but I want to hear your opinion."

"Bad."

"What does *bad* mean to you?

"Bad is when people are not happy with you, because you did not meet their expectations."

"But do you know why is it bad? Have you ever been in a situation where people don't meet *your* expectations?

"No."

"So everyone were nice to you for the last month?"

"No, I just know what to expect."

"OK, Ayer, you want us to go through your transcripts. We have the empty sheet at that test of yours. We talked about consistency of behaviour, right? And the incident with the girl? You really shouldn't have put your principal in a situation where he needs to apologise to you."

"You cannot hold me accountable for his reactions."

"Ayer, we discussed this, we are not holding you accountable for anything, we are just trying to help you get along. 

"But I am getting along just fine."

"No you are not, Ayer, and the fact that you are not realising it does not speak good for you. Why were you at the principal's office again, I know that you were not to blame but I cannot really interfere with that, as we've discussed several times. It is against the law."

"And so is recording my life, without my permission!"

"My poor, confused thing... How can what we do be against the law, when we are doing it, and we are the police."

---

At this point Vince would close the notebook. He would try to contact Jane, so he can discuss what he saw, only discover that she had long left (and to realise that having her with him wouldn't make things any different). Then, desperate for closure, he would reach out for Ayer's personal contacts and (not realising that his phone was laying at the bottom of the river) would write a long and melodramatic letter, containing multiple occurences of phrases like "sorry" and "I had no idea" and in which he would promise that the Scotland Yard, now a new and much more tollerant organisation having nothing to do with the people who approved the program would find a way to compensate him and would help him overcome his trauma.

That night, Vince decided to go home without his car.
