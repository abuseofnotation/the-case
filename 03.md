The Case of Guy Moscovitz
---

Upon arriving at work, Vince discovered the door of his room opened. He leaned down to see if someone was inside, and when he saw him he entered immediately: "Ayer! What are you doing here?"

"I work here." Cadman was standing on the visitor's chair next to Vince's desk. "I wasn't notified otherwise, at least."

"How the hell are we supposed to notify you about anything, when you don't even visit the office?" 

"I am here now." Ayer said, "I solved a case this night." he added as if this was not the sole reason he came at the Yard.

"Was it the one we hired you for?" Vince asked, but Ayer did not respond. "A man called Guy Moscovitz." He said. "Arrives from Israel about a month ago. Steals two paintings from the Museum of Natural Arts. Your system locates him with no problem and five minutes later your colleagues are at the door. But here comes the interesting part: He is not in his room. Neither he is in any other room, nor anywhere else in the hotel. And nobody had seen him since then."

"His identity?"

"Stolen. The real Guy Moskovitz is at the other end of the world."

"Alright. So what new can you to tell me about this?"

"Where do I start? Firstly, this person, who stole the paintings, he does not really exist." 

Vince frowned. "OK, we should probably go get some coffee." Ayer said.

Vince already had coffee at home, but he did not think that mentioning this would make any difference. So he got up from his desk and took Ayer to the canteen, where he got a Cappucino with double milk and finally started talking in a manner which was a little less obscure:

"First I did a small research," he started, "and I discovered that this was not the first time that Guy Moscovitz becomes invisible. According to the Detective, when he arrived to London, he travelled from the airport to his hotel without a single camera capturing him. The hotel, where Mr Moskovitz checked in is at the end of the city and there are a lot of blokes who live there full-time, just because it is a little cheaper than renting an actual apartment. One of them, John Tally, is an ex-con artist. And incidentally," Ayer made a pause to take a sip from his coffee, "he and the so-called Mr Moskovitz were never out of the building at the same time."

"And you think that-"

"What I think is roughly the following: John Tally aquired Guy Moskovitz's identity and he used it to make a reservation at the hotel room next to the one he was inhabiting. Shortly after the plane landed he dressed in this ridiculous suit of his and comes at the lobby to pick up the key, presenting himself as Guy Moskovitz. After that, your records were in the state in which he wanted them to be, and from there on he was free to act the rest of his plan."

"Ayer, you are a smart boy." Vince continued. "But I feel that you would make for a lousy police person - the world just isn't as weird and mysterious as you imagine it to be."

"Maybe it's not." Ayer said. "But in this case I checked the airline records. There wasn't a Mr Moscovitz on board."

"Are you sure?"

"And I contacted John Tally, the con artist. At least I attempted to do so, only to discover that he is gone."

"So this really *did* happen? But how the did he thought of that?" Vince's question was directed more at himself than to Ayer. "How the hell?"

Ayer smiled, "Well now that you are asking, maybe someone else directed him," Ayer said and then added, "Actually, that is what I came here to discuss."

Confrontation
---

The conference room was huge, especially compared to the small amount of people in it. The screen was turned off and it seemed like it was there only to reflect the light coming from hundreds of LED-s, which were mounted to the ceiling. Ayer sat at one of the many free chairs and nodded to Pankill, Jane, while they were going through the daily agenda. He waited patiently for his turn to come, without saying a word. 

"Hello. So, I think that there are several cases which are related to each other and are also related to the case that I am officially working - the murder of Den Lee. And I want to talk about that if you don't mind. Perhaps I should begin with my thoughts of the the Detective. The detective is a fairly rudimentary system. And that is OK, because most of the crimes are equally rudimentary. Triviality, if I may say so, is king. However this rule has several exceptions - as in "exceptional", that is. Cases like the vault robbery and the alleged murder of Den Lee are another category of crimes - their planning and execution is both flawless, in fact so flawless, that you even hesitate to share with me how are they executed. Cases like these are the reason why you hired a consulting detective like me to work alongside your colleagues. What I am about to tell you might surprise you, although it is actually quite logical: I thing that the authors of these crimes are using some consultancy of their own."

"Imagine if there was a person or people who is connected to everything that is happening right now." Ayer said. "I will call him "Moriaty" - that is the name of a famous criminal from the Victorian era. Everybody who commited crimes in the past three months may be connected to Moriarty. And it is my firm conviction that Den Lee knew him personally."

"And where did you get all this from?" Jane said while Ayer was still talking.

"I'd have to step up," Pankill said, "and say that while I do agree that the fact that so many unresolved cases were opened almost simulaneously certainly does not *look* like a coincidence." he made a pause to catch a breath, "but judging by the *information* that we have about them, I still think it will be most reasonable to accept it as such."

"That is how do we get to the second important observation that I made during my four week stay in ythe Yard." Ayer said. "The alghorithm that you are using is not sophisticated enough for you to even call the data you have of these crimes 'information'. You cannot catch a shark with a fishing rod. And neither can I. 

"OK, stop Ayer. I believe this is your personal preference and difference in background speaking.  I mean, I know that our way of working is not your cup of tea. But, mate, you are not even trying! Yes, our files contain nothing more than a list of facts. And yes, our alghoritm is only a little more than an application of the stimulus-response model. But can humans really be more complicated than that? I mean try to read the darn files for starters. You will probably find out that if you have the biography of a given person in front of you, and you connect the dots, you will have a pretty darn good idea about what this person is all about."

"Then how good of an idea you have about *me*?" Ayer looked at Vince with a grimace. 

"And because we don't, we cannot trust you." Jane said. "Especially when you have a hinge, which might be enough for you when you are working alone but it is generally not enough for us."

"How can I give you anything more when I probably cannot even see most of the cases that I am referring to in your system?"


"Let's switch the viewpoint for a moment. How the hell do you expect us to grant you permission of all that data that you requested? More specifically - why? On what grounds? Because you seem nice? Because some people from your neighbourhood are fond of you? You desire from us to access cases which are at a highest level of secrecy and at the same time you didn't want to share a single fact about your life."

To her and Vince's surpise, after this remark Ayer lowered his voice and started sounding a lot less confident: "Honestly, I don't know what do you need to know about me, but I know my rights and I really like to keep my personal life."

"I assure you that nobody cares about your *personal* life." Jane said. "It is your professional practices that we are accessing, and we really have trouble doing so.

"But I just want to help," his voice sounded so desperate and eager that Jane really did stop speaking. "Please stop." he said with his face buried with his hands as if he was about to burst into tears. 

"You have children. You handle this!" Jane turned to Vince. He sat next to Ayer and waited for him to come down before starting to speak: "Look Ayer, here's the deal - we really like some of your ideas. And we really want to help you solve this case. In order to do that though, we have to be assured that you know what you are doing and at the moment we are not, and cannot be, simply because we don't know anything about you. Because Ayer, as hard it is for me to admit it, your remark was absolutely correct - the data from your file tells us nothing about who you are and how the hell have you gained the experience that you have. So currently your persona constitutes one more unknown term in our equasion and believe me when I say that we have enough of those already."

"But, I have nothing to hide." Ayer said. "Nothing."

"Then tell us. Tell us how you became what you are."

"Alright," Ayer's face regained his usual emotionless expression. "How much time do we have?"

"I didn't want to be mediocre" 
---
 
"I didn't want to be mediocre," Ayer spoke fast and stopped only to take a sip from the cup of Cappucino that Vince had brought him. "I wanted everything I do to be perfect, but at the same time I had no idea what that meant or how could I achieve it. As a result, I missed most of my life, as a youth. I was apathetic - I went to university after school because that's what everybody does, I worked what my father had arranged for me, because it was the easiest thing I could do. I spent my free time reading books. I thought that this was making me better than everyone else. Actually it was more like the opposite.", Ayer was smiling as he was speaking. "Although it helped me immersely."

"You can skip the personal details if you want." Vince said."Now when you speak about work, you are referring to a dry-cleaning place, where you met Robert?" 

"Correct," Ayer said and continued with his story, "The business belonged to my father. Naturally, he wanted to hand it to me after he retired. I did not want to offend him. I did everything that he asked from me, but nothing extra, as he'd always taught me to do exactlu what I was told. So one day he came to me and told me that I am a complete failure. He was drunk at the time and the next day he denied ever having said that, but a few weeks after I was still poundering at his line of logic: "I do everything that I am told and in some way I still fail. How come?"

He made a brief pause and when he started speaking again with voice filled with emotion.

"He could not explain it to me, but I understood it... See, I was like him. I was not being myself. I was not doing what I *had* to do.

"Ayer, please." Jane said, but he wasn't paying attention to her. And the more she was trying to direct his narrative, the more clearly she envisioned the labyrinth which was in his head. There were very few places where his thoughts could alter their routes, and even less destinations that he could arrive at. So the best that they could hope for was that this one was at least close to where they wanted to get.

"So what is mediocrity, really?" Ayer continued. "Do you think you have answered this question for yourselves? Because I did. Mediocrity is *convenience*. Comfort if you must. If, when you wake up, you already want to know how your day will end, then you will be happy with it being nothing more than what you expect from it. And if it indeed is, then what difference does it make whether you spent it woke or asleep?"

"Comfort had always been goal number one for my family and for everyone else that surrounded me," Ayer continued, "Everything they did was related, directly or indirectly, to their desire for their life to be easier and smoother. And so it was. But me, it was then when I realized that I prefer it to be hard. Exactly as hard as it has to be."

"Is this why you became a low-tek?" Vince asked.

"I can think of a hundred labels which I can put on you, her and everyone else I met here in the Yard and which are a thousand times more accurate and meaningful than 'low tek'."

"OK Ayer, but focus on the details, please." Vince added. "Your internal conflicts are not really what's rellevant here."

"Fine" Ayer said, "I was finished anyway." And then he continued: "After cutting comfort our of the equation, deciding what I want to do with my life was easy. It took me a few minutes to ask myself "Why am I here and not there?" and to start acting accordingly. I immediately realized I need to go where they needed me and my abilities. You might want to ask my landlord, Mrs Johnson, for the exact date of my arrival at her house. But for me it was about five years ago. I went there with three bags of luggage and one of them still stands untouched in my closet - that is how detached I was from my actual needs. There I met many people for a really short period of time: everyone was interested in meeting the weird fellow who moved to their neighbourhood on purpose. I used this attention to aquire contacts: many people were asking me what do for a living and I was happy to answer them. I told them that what I am in the business of finding lost things, something like that.

"And have you had any luck?" Vince asked.

"Barely. In the first month I must have offered my services to nearly a hundred people and none of them wished to use them, even for free. But I wasn't expecting anything different - for me the important thing was that they knew what I do and when they can find me.

"And how did you sustain a living during this period?" Vince asked.  
"I worked as a porter for a daily wage. Hard work, but bearable once you get used to it."

"So again no way to verify what you are saying." Jane said. "Interesting..."

"Tell me what can you "verify" about the average person living  outside of your zoo?" Ayer said. "I am sure that it won't be much more. If you really want to be sure about this particular fact, I can direct you to a person who can testify that I was indeed working there. And I am postitive he will remember me, as later he became my first client."

Ayer's Debut
---

"You know, colleagues of mine have one huge advantage over practitioners of other professions - our clients are often desperate. And desperate people are willing to believe every person who tells them that there is hope. Such was the case with the first person who hired me. Three days before he came to my office he had sent his dauther to school, like every other day. He hadn't seen her since then. When I started working I assumed that the girl is alive, as the opposite would deem the whole endeavour pointless. From this it followed that the person or people I was seeking lived in a huge apartment, where they can remain unnoticed, probably even a house. Also, they probably had a lot of free time. And while these two things weren't nearly enough for doing anything, one more assumption from my side filled the gap: unlike most of the people who live at our neighbourhood, my client was a very engaged parent who didn't leave his daughter alone very often. Because of this, I assumed that whoever kidnapped her did not pick her at random - he had probably been watching her for a long time.

I interviewed a lot of people who knew the girl: doctors, teachers, etc. When that didn't work, I asked my client to draw me a map of his daughter's route to school and started walking through it at approximately the same hour that she used to do it. In that way I encountered a match - a person who was rich, had a lot of free time and did not talk to his neighbours too much. However I wasn't sure I was right. Because that person was a woman.

The person whom I am talking about was an elderly widow, who lived alone at a house that originally belonged to her husband. After his dead, she had lived a lonely life - none of her neighbours could tell me anything about her. I examined her trash can and found a branded toystore bag. At that time this was enough reason for me to break into her house. The girl was there. I found her sleeping in a fully furnished children's room. I took her by her hand and got her to her parents, disregarding the widow. Months later I learned that she never had a kid, because her husband didn't want to, and after his death she had been too old to adopt one. It was then when I considered the case closed."

---

"OK, that's better." Vince said, "I even found some information about the woman. We can probably even register the case in our system post-mortem. Is there anything else you can tell us?" Jane asked.

"Yes. After this one, everything changed. Everybody in the neighbourhood knew me even before solving ig. But after that they also knew that I was for real. 

"I see, so you probably had a lot of clients."

"They came for all kinds of tasks, both large and small. I didn't turn off any of them, so I worked at three cases at a time. I can tell you about the ones I remember."

"Do that," Vince said.

Ayer told them about five more cases, without missing a beat. He was very detailed, so when he got to begin the sixth one, Jane stopped him:

"Let's not go there." She said. "Vince?"

"OK, I suppose that is enough," he said. "Now we will tell you what happened the night the vault got mugged."

"Really?" Ayer asked.

Vince frowned: "Ever heard me joking?"

The Women in Black
---

"OK, let's start by restating what I already know." Ayer started. "The public vault was stormed last week at about nine in the evening, and, judging by the way the entrance looked the next day, I suppose that a bomb of some kind was involved. I saw the recording of the security camera, showing a girl escaping from the building. She wasn't carrying anything with her, which leds me to believe that what she did was to move the contents of the stormed deposit boxes into a deposit box of her possetion. This, by itself, is pretty clever, but I suppose it is not the *only* clever thing that she did, or else you wouldn't be so secretive."

"Pankill," Vince said, "can you pick up from where he left off?"

"Sure," Pankill said and turned on the screen. "What you are about to see are strictly confidential records from vault robbery, so please take it seriously. Anyways, when the suspect left the building, we were ready,"  

//TODO mention how cases disapear, mention the vault robbery

On the screen, Ayer saw the silhoette of a young girl, wearing a black dress and high heels. She was displayed from several camera angles as she exited the building. 

"The image wasn't good enough for us to identify her," Pankill continued. "but we were quite able to track her down, as I showed you before-"

On the screen, Ayer saw a map of the city, where the whereabouts of the girl were marked with a red spot.

"So at first it seemed that there was no way that she could get away. When this happened."

The red spot split into two identical red spots, which began moving to different directions. Several seconds later the same thing happened again. And yet again, untill the number of sport on the screen was five.

"And before you asked, there was nothing wrong with our system that day. It was just that when it identifies one person from another by using a combination of physical characteristics like height, clothes, hairstyle et cetera. In normal cases, this alghorithm works perfectly. But if you specifically aim to deceive it, then breaking it, honestly, is quite easy.

The girl walked to the end of the street where awaiting for her there were four identically looking and identically dressed girls. They did not look like there were aware of her, they were just standing at the corner, looking at different directions.  She took a peak at the only camera that was tracking her and dove in the group, in a way that made it impossible to keep track of her identity.

"So you failed to arrest them?" Ayer asked.

"We got them, alright." Pankill said. "Most of them were prostitutes, but were completely innocent, at least when it comes to the case at hand. One of them is, of course, the one who did it, but we cannot find out which one is it, let alone prove that she is guilty. So this is where the story ends for now."

Ayer did not speak and he looked like he was not there at all.

"A trully unusual case, right?" Vince continued, "But I think it is safe to say that it definitely isn't an instance of organized crime."

"It is safe to say," Ayer repeated after Vince tried to extract an answer from him with his stare. "One question. How many were the suspects, again?"

"How many? Eight, I think."

"I suposed so." Ayer nodded.

"What do you have on your mind?" Jane said.

"If you are really interested, you'll have to come with me?"

"Where?" she asked.

"At my office."

---

"I understand he is awkward." Vince said while him and Jane were taking the elevator to the parking. "But does that mean we should let him get on our nerves."

"I am not nervous." Jane said. "Plus. What, you don't think he will deliver?"

"I hope he will."

"Maybe he just needs a mentor." Jane said. "Someone who went through the same stuff as he goes and managed to employ his emotions into something constructive," she looked at Vince.

"Yes, very funny." Vince said as he was starting the engine.

Connections
---

When they stopped by the house, it was already dark. Ayer got out of the car first and went to open the door.

"Ayer is that you?" Vince and Jane heard the voice of the woman that they met earlier.

"It's me, alright." he responed. 

"Jolly good." The woman came by the door as they were entering. "And these are your new clients, which you don't tell me anything about. Care for a cup of tea?"

"I am sorry, m'am we're not allowed to drink at work." Jane said. 

"Oh, I see." She said as she made way for them, "So *that* is why Ayer was working so hard last night. I could hear him from my bedroom."

"'cuse me? Hear him?" Vince said. Anyway, we gotta go now." 

---

Vince remembered the room that he was about to enter. There was a round table in the middle of it, two armchairs in one of the corners, and a desk on the other. He also remembered the newspaper clippings that were hanging on from the wall. 

When he entered, everything looked different - The carpet was removed, the furniture was placed at the corners of the room, and the room itself looked much brighter. The newspaper clippings that previously occupied just the white board, now were spread across the entire room. But not all of the sheets of paper were from newspapers. He got a bit closer to verify his suspision, and although he could not get near enough to read them, he saw them well enough: those were excepts from various Scotland Yard files, apparently printed. The other two walls were also plastered with paper - photographs from the evidence room. There were also multiple strings of cord, that were streched across the room.

"What the hell is this?" Vince turned to Ayer who was just about to enter.

"Stop it, Vince," Jane said.

"No, I am not stopping anything, until this man gets what he deserves-"

"...which is a formal warning, if I am not mistaken," Jane said.

"How the hell did he get all this?"

"Full disclosure: I left my computer on, on purpose," Jane said. "Seeing how Ayer worked I thought it might be useful for him. Regarding the photographs, I don't know how they are made, but I assume our security guys will have some explaining to do."

Vince shrugged: "Alright, you deal with all of this then," and then he looked at the collage this time more carefully, "What *is* it, anyway?"

"Well, I assume these represent relations." Jane said and she pointed to one of the tens of strings of cord. Looking closely, Vince realized that each of them connected a picture from the front wall and a newspaper clipping, or a file, from the wall on the left. There was some stuff on the third wall too but there weren't as many strings coming from it.

"Great, so he basically created a physical version of our database." Vince said.

"Except that in this one, Den's pictures are somehow related to our cases" Jane said. "What is this about?"

Ayer did not give her any answer, so she rushed to the wall to check for herself. He quickly found a case that she knew about - it was the case of Guy Moskovitz, which Ayer had solved in the same day - and followed the string. It lead to a picture of one of Den's dolls  - a small male figure, with a large beard and a hat.

"Is this why you called us?" Vince screamed while pointing to the picture, "Because of a meagre resemblanse between two totally unrelated events?"

"If it was only one, I wouldn't bother." Ayer said. "But Last night I managed to solve at least three more cases by analysing patterns in Den's art, and relating them to crimes. And I can say that there are obvious connections for at least two more. Yes, this is why you are here.

"OK," Vince started looking at the pictures, "and where are the others."

"Forget about the others." Ayer said. "Look *this one*."

And he pointed to one big picture, which was placed at the center of the wall. On it, there were eight identical-looking dolls - all of Den's dolls looked more or less identical, but these ones were different - they had no decoration, they even lacked most face features. And unlike most kokeshi dolls, which were painted with many bright colours, these were painted in solid black. This picture wasn't connected to anything.

"I didn't know what this one meant," Ayer continued. "Untill I learned about the robbery."

"You are crazy!" Vince said.

"True, but not related." Ayer's response was immediate.

"I took all pictures from your archives." He continued. "There is no feasible explanation to there being so many similarities between Den's art and between crimes some of which weren't even commited when it was made."

"Unless?" Vince was asking Ayer, but it was Jane who responded instead:

"Unless everything is connected. With her at the top."

"From absurdity, everything follows." Vince said with pathos.

"Vince, shut up." Jane said, "Ayer, leave us for a sec, will you? We need to examine all of this in private."

---

He came some fifteen minutes later. He was holding an opened book in his right hand which he carefully left it on his desk so not to lose his page. 

At first Vince and Jane didn't hear him entering and he noticed that their manner of speech was quite different from the one they were using in public. It was much more informal. They almost didn't speak in sentences, but in sounds and grimaces. Once they saw him they became completely silent.

"Ayer, it is good to see you again." Vince said, "Look, after we examined your theory more closely we think that there might be some truth in it. Enough for us to allow you to continue developing it as a full-time investigator in the Scotland Yard. Welcome aboard." Vince got up to shake his hand but Ayer stepped aside.

"What does that mean?"

"It means a lot of things, actually." Vince said. " It means that you will be one of the youngest people to attain this position. It means that you will be required to be at our office every day. And, what probably most interests you - you will be able to request info, meet with withnesses et cetera.

"I wasn't asking about the position, I am asking about your decision. Where are you going with this? What is your endgame?"

"Comfort..." Jane said. "For us, that is. For you it is solving complex problems untill your nose bleeds... Or afterwards if it suits you."

"Yes, but why are hiring *me*. When you were pretty clear that you don't believe my theories. Or maybe your opinions differ?"

"You seem to know very little about communication, and cooperation with other people." Vince said. "But we think that you can learn with time. We don't believe *you* but we believe *in* you. Whatever is happening is definitely not what you think it is. But still, if anyone can understand it its you. And you *will* understand it! We will help you."

"OK" Ayer said.

"Your tools"
===

When he got to his office, Pankill was still half-asleep. He took off his jacket, along with his backpack, placed them on the floor and leaned to take out his laptop.

"Hello Pankill," He heard a loud voice, which startled him, he jumped towards the door and tripped over his backpack. "It's OK," The voice continued, "It's just me," and it started sounding familiar, enough for Pankill to turn see its author.

"Cadman?" he shouted, "What the... You scared me!"

"Yeah, I noticed," Ayer said. "For a person who is in charge of security, you don't feel very safe."

"How can I help you?"

"So I wanted you to show me a thing or two about this system of your." 

"What exactly?"

"You know. Everything?"

Pankill looked Ayer in a way that made him feel like he was obliged to elaborate:

"So yeah... I am back on the case. Full time. Happy for us working together. I know that I ignored you the first time, but I assure you that now it will be different. If you agree to help me and work with me, I will do anything you want me to. 

"Well you can get off my chair, for starters!" Pankill said. He watched Ayer as he stood up and almost jumped through the desk to the other part of the room. He didn't get calm until he positioned on his place, like any other day and after doing so, he immediately started his machine. After a few second both Ayer and he saw the then-familiar face of the "Detective" application.

"No, not with this program." Ayer said. "It sucks."

"And what makes you say that?" Pankill replied.

"Just one thing." I've never seen *you* using it."

"Me?" Pankill asked, his mind constantly shifting between anger and amazement.

"Yes you," Ayer said, "Both when we viewed the records of the vault robbery and when you were showing that stuff to Vince, you never opened the "Detective" You used other programs, like the one with the dark background, where you type some text and it gives you responses. How is it called."

"What, the command-line?" Pankill said, "But that is not really a program."

"So what it is?" Ayer said, "I know that you won't use anything else but the best. So I want to use your programs."

"Listen. these tools, they are not very intuitive to work with. I use them simply because I am used to them. And you are not."

"I want to use your programs," Ayer repeated.

"Alright, let's hope you are serious," Pankill said. And with a press of a button he made the whole graphical user interface of his computer disapear. His whole screen became completely black, save for a single white cursor which was blinking on the top-left corner, where presumably the commands would go. "Hello darkness my old friend...", he hummed to himself.
