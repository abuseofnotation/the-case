*...in which several cases are examined and a connection between them is suggested*

The Case of Guy Moscovitz
———

Upon arriving at work, Vince discovered that the door of his office was already opened. He knew that he had locked it the previous day so he didn't enter immediately. Instead he leaned down and tried to see if someone was inside. And there indeed was. A boy with a strange posture was standing on the visitor's chair next to his desk.

"Ayer!" Vince shouted as he entered his office, "What are you doing here?"

"Well I was under the impression that I still work here," Ayer responded, "At least I wasn't notified otherwise."

"Well how are we supposed to notify you about anything when you don't visit the office?" 

"Well, I am here now. And I came to tell you that I know where Guy Moscovitz is."

"Cadman, I have stuff to do." Vince said. "Please leave me alone... Or if you want to discuss something, would it be hard for you to start at the begginning?"

"OK," Ayer said, "I solved a case this night."

"Was it the one we hired you for?"

"No but it is related."

"That seems a bit far fetched."

For the first time Vince thought he could read a clear emotion in Ayer's face. It was anger.

"Case number 2342," Ayer started. "A man called Guy Moscovitz. Arrived to London from Israel before about a month. Stole two paintings... from the Museum of Natural arts, I believe, by knocking out two guards and rushing away. Your system locates him with no problem and five minutes later your colleagues were at his door. But he is not in his room. Neither he is in any other room, nor anywhere else in the hotel. And nobody had seen him since then."

"His identity?"

"Stolen. The real Guy Moskovitz is at the other end of the world."

"Alright. So what can you to tell me?"

"Where do I start? This person, who stole the paintings, he does not really exist."

Vince frowned, "This, by itself, tells me nothing."

"OK. First I did a small research and I discovered that this was not the first time that Guy Moscovitz becomes invisible. When he arrives in London he allegedly goes from the airport to his hotel without any camera recording him. The distance he passed was just one kilometer and he travelled by night but still... Also at all occurences when a camera *did* recorded him, he always looked the same way: large beard, which is almost certainly fake, and a large hat. He did not even change its clothes..."

"Well a person who maintains a fake identity will always try to conceal as much of his real one as possible."

"Yes, but why bother to leave the house at all, when you know you are being tracked like a lab rat?" Ayer said. "This does not make much sense. Unless..."

And then he continued: "The hotel where Mr Moskovitz checked in is at the end of the city. It is not a very luxurious place. In fact there are a lot of lower-class folks who live there just because it is a little cheaper than getting an actual apartment. One of them is John Tally who was an ex-burglar. Incidentally he and the so-called Mr Moskovitz were never went out of the building at the same time.

"And you think that-"

"I think roughly the following: John Tally aquires Guy Moskovitz's identity and uses it to make a reservation at the hotel room next to the one he is living at. Shortly after the plane lands he dresses in his ridiculous suit and comes at the lobby to pick up the key - now your records are in the state in which he wants them to be. And Guy Moskovitz is created."

"But how the hell did he thought of that?" Vince's question was directed more at himself than to Ayer.

"Well, he just did." Ayer said. 

"No. You don't understand. That does not happen. Not till recently, anyways.

Ayer smiled: "Well, maybe someone else directed him," and then added, "Actually, that is what I came to discuss."

Confrontation
---

The conference room was huge, at least compared to the amount of people in it. The screen was turned off and it seemed it was there only to reflect the lights from the hundreds of LED-s, which were mounted to the ceiling. Ayer sat at one of the many free chairs and nodded to Pankill, Jane and a couple of other people that he recognized. They started discussing various matters that he knew nothing about, so he just sat there waiting for his turn to come. 

"Hello gentlemen," he started. "For those who don't know me, my name is Ayer Cadman. Mr Blinkhorn invited me to speak here. I believe I have a hint, that will enable us to solve some of the more complex cases that we are dealing with."

"Which cases in particular?" Someone asked.

"I believe that there are several of them which are related to each other and are also related to the case that I am officially working on: the murder of Den Lee."

"Firstly, there is no evidence which shows that Den has been murdered." the bright lights prevented Ayer from seeing the face of the person who was speaking.

"OK, let me first share how our situation looks from my viewpoint," Ayer said, "What we have is a fairly rudimentary system. And that is OK, because 99 percent of the crimes are equally rudimentary. But beside them we also have a couple of cases like the vault robbery and the murder of Den Lee, which are the exact opposite. They are inspiring. Their planning and execution is both flawless. So flawless, that you even hesitate to share with some of us how are they done. For me, this reason alone would suggest that they are the work of the same people. That is not to say that is the only evidence I got."

Everyone at the room started whispering to one another.

"Well, so what *do* you got?" Jane said.

"I'd tell me, but you wouldn't believe me." Ayer responded, "I will need more time. And also more information."

"Hold down a second Ayer," Vince said, "Its true that I did invite you to share your thoughts regarding the recent crime epidemic, and I do agree with you that the fact so many unresolved cases were opened almost simulaneously certainly does not *look* like a coincidence. Still judging by the information that we have about them, and particularily about Den Lee, I still think it will be most reasonable to accept it as such."

"And this is where we get to the second issue that I wanted to discuss."

"Namely?"

"I don't consider the contents of your files information." Ayer said. "They are just data. When a case is trivial enough data is all you need. But when the connections are more complicated, then it-"

"Please, Ayer!" Vince interrupted him. "I know that our way of working is not your cup of tea. But, mate, you are not even trying! Yes, it is true that our files contain nothing more than a list of facts. And that our alghorith, is only a little more than an application of the stimulus-response model. But are humans much more complicated than that? I mean try to read the darn files for starters. If you have a biography of a given person in front of you, and you connect the dots, you will have a pretty darn good idea about what this person is all about."

"Really? Then how good of an idea you have about *me*." Ayer looked at Vince with a grimace.

"And because we don't, we cannot trust you." Jane said. "And we cannot trust your hunch about all these cases being connected. I mean it *seems* plausible, but it is still a hunch. And a hunch is not enough. 

Ayer stood up and something in him snapped:

"Fair enough,"  Ayer's tone was only slightly nervious, but his face was all red. "However please note that I cannot just generate new hypothesis with a press of a button. What I *think* is what I believe in. I cannot just stop believing in it, nor I can make it less truthful."

"So I thing that we have just two choices, you and I," he turned to Vince and Jane who were sharing one desk, like two old classmates, "Either you change your opinion and thrust me over everything I need to proove this hunch of mine, or I will wish you all the best and go home."

"We will discuss this later." Vince responded, "Who"s next to speak?"

---

The people stood up and started trooping off, but Ayer stood in his place:

"One more thing," he said, "Can you please stop tracking me? I believe you have better things to do with your time." 

"You think we are doing it just for the hell of it?" Jane said. "Because I thought that you are smarter than that!"

To her surpise Ayer lowered his voice and started sounding a lot less confident, "Why then? Why are you doing it?"

"Allow me to retort." Jane responded. "How the hell do you expect us to grant you permission of all that data that you requested? More specifically - why? Because you seem nice? Because some people from your neighbourhood are fond of you? You want to access cases which are at a highest level of secrecy available. And at the same time you don't even want to share a single fact about your life."

"I just want to help." Ayer buried his face with his hands as he spoke. "That is all."

"How?" Vince asked, "By constantly showing off how good you are?"

Ayer said nothing and kept his head low as if he was about to burst into tears. 

"What happen here?" Jane turned to Vince.

Vince, did not respond anything and turned to Ayer instead:

"Look boy, we really want to help you. But in order to do that we have to be assured that you know what you are doing. And at the moment we are not, and cannot be, simply because we don't know anything about you. Because, your remark from the previous conversation was absolutely correct, at least when it comes to yourself - the data from your file tells us nothing about who you are and how the hell did you gained the experience you have. So currently your persona constitutes one more unknown term in our equasion and, believe me, we have enough of those already."

"But, I don't have anything to hide." Ayer said.

"Then tell us. Tell us how you became what you are."

"Alright," Ayer stopped crying and his face regained his usual emotionless expression. "How much time do we have?"

Ayer's Story
———
 
"I wanted to escape from mediocrity," he spoke fast and stopped only to take a sip from his coffee, "As a child this was haunted by the idea that everything I do has to be perfect, but at the same time I had no idea what that meant or how could I achieve it. As a result I was apathetic, basically - I went to university after school because that's what everybody does, I worked what my father had arranged for me, because it was the easiest thing I could do. I spent my free time reading books. I thought that this made me better than everyone else. Actually it was more like the opposite.", Ayer was smiling as he was speaking.

"When you speak about work, you are referring to a dry-cleaning place, where you met Robert?" Vince asked.

"Correct."

"And it was owned by your father?"

"Yes. My father wanted me to help him expand it. I did not want to offend him so I did everything that he asked from me, but nothing extra. So one day he came to me and told me that I am a complete failure. He was drunk when he did that and the next day he denied having said it, but a few weeks after I was still poundering at his line of logic: "I do everything that I am told and in some way I still fail. How come?"

He made a brief pause and when he started speaking again, his voice filled with emotion.

"He could not explain it to me, but I understood it... I was like him. I was not being myself, I was not leaving my mark. I was not doing what I was was born to do.

"Ayer, please." Jane said, but he did not pay attention to her"

"So what is mediocrity, really?" Ayer continued. "You think you have answered this question for yourselves? Because I did. Mediocrity is *convenience*, Comfort as you must. If when you wake up you already want to know how your day will end, then you *want* it to be nothing more than what you expect from it. And if it does, what difference does it make on whether you are woke or asleep?"

"Comfort had always been goal number one for my family and for everyone else that surrounded me," he continued, "Everything they did was related, directly or indirectly, to their desire for their life to be easier and smoother. And so it was. But me, I prefer it to be hard."

"Sounds beautiful" Jane said. "And I don"t believe a word of it."

"Yes Ayer, focus on the details." Vince added. "Your internal conflicts are not really what's rellevant here."

---

"After cutting comfort our of the equation, deciding what I want to do with my life was easy. It took me a few minutes to ask myself "Why am I here and not there?", and to start acting accordingly. I immediately realized I need to go where they needed me and my abilities."

"You might want to ask my landlord, Mrs Johnson, for the exact date of my arrival at her house, but for me it was about five years ago. I went there with three bags of luggage, one of which still stands untouched in my closet. There I a got to know a lot of people for a short period of time: everyone was interested in meeting the weid guy who moved to their neighbourhood on purpose. I used this attention to aquire contacts: many people were asking me what do I do for a living and I was happy to answer them. I told them that what I am in the business of finding lost things, or something like that.

"And have you had any luck?" Vince asked.

"Barely. In the first month I must have offered my services to nearly a hundred people and none of them wished to use them, even for free. But I wasn't expecting anything different - the important thing was for them to know what I do and when they can find me.

"And how did you sustain a living during this period?" Vince asked.

"I worked as a porter for a daily wage. Hard work, but bearable when you get used to it."

"So again no way to verify what you are saying." Jane said. "Interesting..."

"Tell me what do you know about the average Low Tek?" Ayer said. "No, look, if you really want to, I can get a person to testify that I was indeed working there. I am postitive he will remember me. As later he became my first client."

Ayer's Debut
———

You know, people who work as detectives have one huge advantage over practitioners of other professions - our clients are often desperate. And desperate people are willing to believe every person who tells them that there is hope. The first person who hired me was a colleague of mine. Three days before he came to me he had sent his dauther to school,like every other day. He hadn't seen her since then.

I assumed that the girl is alive, as the opposite would deem the whole endeavour pointless. From this it followed that the man I was seeking lived in a huge apartment, where he can go unnoticed, probably even a house. Also he probably had a lot of free time. And while these two things weren't nearly enough for doing anything, one more assumption from my side filled the gaps: I knew that my client was a very engaged parent who didn't leave his daughter alone very often, so I assumed that whoever kidnapped his dauther did not pick her at random - he had probably been watching her for a long time.

Firstly, I interviewed a lot of people who knew the girl: doctors, teachers, etc. When that didn't work, I asked my client to draw me a map of his daughter's route to school and started walking through it at approximately the same hour that she used to do it. In that way I encountered a match - a person who was rich, had a lot of free time and did not talk to his neighbours too much. However I wasn't sure I was right. Because that person was a woman.

---

The person whom I am talking about was an elderly widow, who lived alone at a house that originally belonged to her husband. After his dead, she had lived a lonely life - none of her neighbours could tell me anything about her. I examined her trash can and found a rejected adoption papers. At that time this was enough reason for me to break into her house. 

The girl was there. I found her sleeping in a fully furnished children's room. I took her by her hand and got her to her parents. The next day her father and twenty of his friends stormed the widow's  house but she was gone. 

Months later I learned that she never had a kid, because her husband didn't want to, and after his dead she had been too old to adopt one. It was then when I considered the case closed.

"OK, that's better." Vince said, "I even found some information about the woman. We can probably even register the case in our system post-mortem."

"Any other cases that you have worked on?" Jane asked.

"After this one, everything changed." Ayer said. "Before it, everybody in the neighbourhood knew me. After it, they also knew that I was for real. I worked on three cases at a time."

"I see, so you probably had a lot of clients."

"They came for all kinds of tasks, both large and small. I didn't turn off any of them, so I worked at three cases at a time. I can tell you about the ones I remember."

"Do that," Vince said.

Ayer told them about five more cases, without missing a beat. He was very detailed, so when he got to begin the sixth one, Jane stopped him:

"Let's not go there." She said. "Vince?"
"OK, I suppose that is enough," he said. "We will give you full access to whatever you need."
"Really?" Ayer asked.
"Have you heard me joking about stuff, recently?"

The Women in Black
———

"OK, let's start by restating what I already know." Ayer started. "The public vault was stormed last week at about nine in the evening, and judging by the way the entrance looked the next day there probably a bomb of some kind was involved. I saw the recording of the security camera, showing a girl escaping from the building. She wasn't carrying anything with her, which leds me to believe that what she did was to move the contents of the stormed deposit boxes into a deposit box which she or her clients had rented previously. Which was pretty clever, but I suppose it is not the *only* clever thing that she did, or else you wouldn't be so secretive. Am I right?

"Pankill," Vince said instead of replying to Ayer, "can you pick up from where he left off?"

"Sure, " Pankill said and turned on the screen.

"When the suspect left the building, we were ready, "Ayer saw the silhoette of a young girl, wearing a black dress and high heels"


На екрана се показа силуета на младо момиче. Тя беше облечена в черна рокля и обувки с токчета. В момента в който тя излезе от кадър картината се смени. Друга камера от друго място. Този път момичето беше само малък силует, но отново се виждаше. 

- Знаехме, че образът на камерите нямаше да бъде достатъчно ясен, за да установим самоличността й, но беше напълно достатъчен, за да не я изпускаме от обсега ни.

Панкил натисна няколко клавиша и след малко на екрана се показа карта на града. Местоположението на момичето беше маркирано с червена точка.

- Гледайки нещата от птичи поглед ни изглеждаше, сякаш тя няма къде да се скрие. Но тогава се случи това:

Червената точка се придвижи една пряка на север и тогава до нея изведнъж се появи още една точка. И после още една. След няколко секунди броят на точките беше осем.

- Значи системата ви е отказала? – Айер попита.
- Не. – Панкил каза. – Системата си работеше без проблем. Виж, когато лицето на даден човек не е видно, системата го идентифицира по съвкупност от отличителни белези: ръст, телосложение, цвят на дрехите и косата. В нормалните случаи този алгоритъм работи и е невъзможно да го заблудиш. Но ако си го поставиш за цел... тогава е piece of cake.

След секунда бомбата гръмна. Осем жени, всичките облечени с черни рокли се разбягаха във всички посоки.

- Нищо не разбирам. – Айер попита. - Не ги ли задържахте?
- Да. Ето например какво ни каза една от тях. - Панкил натисна бутона и на екрана се появи момиче, с притеснено изражение и размазан от сълзи грим.

----------

- Ще те попитам пак. – Полицаят, който я разпитваше беше зад кадър. - Какво правеше там и защо беще облечена така?

-  Вижте, парите ми трябваха, а нито една от фирмите, в които кандидатсвах за работа не благоволи да ме извика на интервю... Една приятелка ми казаха, че е е имало някакъв изискан господин, който е бил готов да плати на няколко красиви момичета, само за да го придружат на някакво светско събитие. Отначало ми се стори гнусно, но с нея се познаваме още от деца и тя ми се закле, че няма да ми се наложи да правя абсолютно нищо лошо и незаконно.
- Тя ли ти даде роклята?
Жената кимна.
- Каза че това е задължителен дрескод за мястото където отиваме.

----------

- Повечето от тях бяха проститутки. Панкил продължи. Но бяха невинни, поне що се отнася до случаят, за който говорим сега. Една от тях имаше точна идея къде да отиде за да избяга от нас и естествено успя.
- …защото вие сте били твърде заети да гоните тези, които са нямали идея какво се случва. - Айер допълни. 
- Няма значение. - Винс каза. - Важното е, че няма никаква конспирация, няма сложни планове и като цяло това което се е случило тогава няма никаква връзка със твоя случаи.

Айер не отговори нищо и изглеждаше сякаш въобще не е там.

- Айер?Моля те, потвърди че си съгласен с тази констатация.
- Да видим… Това, което казвате е така, но… това е гениален план. И за мен вече е съвсем очевидно, че е дело на същите хора, които са убили Кейти.

----------

- Побърква ме това дете. – Винс каза.
- Защо?
- Защо ли? Ти да не би да го харесваш?
- Има хъс. Също и способности. Според мен му трябва ментор. Някой който е минал през същите неща, през които и той. Който е овладял страстите си и ги е впрегнал в нещо градивно.
- Ха ха, много смешно. – Винс каза и погледна на другата страна.
- Не съм имал идея да е смешно.
- Тогава явно си глупав. Това момче е свикнало да е винаги номер едно. Той не се поддава на школовка. 
- И докога ще е така.
- Още малко.

След малко телефонът му звънна.

- Какво става? - Беше Винс. - Няма ли най-накрая да вдигнеш.
- Какво има?
- Идвай веднага в залата за разпити.

Това обаждане накара Айер да си забрави мисълта. Щеше да мине много време преди той да има възможност да се върне към нея.
