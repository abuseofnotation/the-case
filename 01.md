The Case
=======

*...in which one very high house of cards crumbles*
 
The Call
----

She picked up the receiver, thinking about the end of her shift. Working in "112" wasn't nearly as exciting as it used to be. These days the line was rarely used for emergencies. Instead, she mostly dealt with crazy old people who were becoming more and more paranoid with age, eventhough these days the crime rate was approaching zero.

'Your name please?' she said.

'助けて!' The answer came with a delay and it was in a language that she did not understand. 

'Can you speak in English please?' She said.  

But the woman at the other end did not fulfil her request, which was unnerving because she seemed genuinely scared.

'Where are you? Where do you live?

'Reggie Street.' the woman said.

Those were her last words.

Jane
-------

The office of Jane Marthello was a huge dusty room, which also served as a warehouse for old pieces of evidence. Vincent, the current CEO of Scotland Yard, did not like to go there but from time to time he had to - Jane was the only person among his colleagues whom he could speak without fearing he might be misunderstood.

'Hello my friend,' he said to her as he entered her office, 'I think he might have a huge problem.'

She turned her head away from her screen and towards him, looked at him for a moment, and then went back to looking at the screen.

'We do.' she said. 'And we have had it since last week, when stuff started happening...'

'I am not talking about that.'

'I know what are you talking about,' she looked at him again, just to show him her angry grimace.

'And?'

'And unlike you I did my homework. And I concluded that nobody but her had visited her apartment. There was noone to throw her out the window. She jumped herself.'

'OK, but you know... The call. Plus the system registered a suspition. How are we gonna finish the case workflow-wise, if you will?'

'Like I am the person who decides that.'

They spend the next minutes in silence.

'OK.' Vince said. 'I agree with you. But... After what happened last week, I feel that we should be extra cautious. Still, the robbery of the public vault is a real case, so keep on digging into that. And I will get someone to come with me to Den's apartment and try to see if there is anything there.'

'Good luck with that.' Jane said, and he spent a second trying to determine if she was being ironic ('You fool! Of course she was').

Boffins
---

Vince started roaming through the open-office space, looking for someone whom he could assign the task of researching an alleged murder. While doing so he once again realized, one,  how many of the people he used to work with were gone and, two, how little he knew about the new colleagues.

Most of them were programmers. 

When Vince started working there, the IT department of "Scotland Yard" was situated at the basement of the building and consisted of three boys supporting a simple document-maintenance system. It grew steadily from then on untill it reached the present point were almost everything was IT, almost everything was maintenance. Currently the whole workforce of "Scotland Yard" consisted of himself and Jane (who were in charge of knowing how everything works), about ten interns (who were doing arrests and other "unpleasant" activities which required direct contact with convicts) and *about three hundred* boffins (that is how they called all techies), most of which spoke only between themselves, had lunch in front of their computers and were only indirectly related to the process of crime-solving.

That last proposition could be confirmed by the calmness, with which they reacted to a certain recent event. In the previous week there were a robbery costing millions of pounds and a few injured victims. Vince expected some of them to take initiative, but all that they were doing was to involve him in an endless debates about whether the technical issue because of which the criminal escaped was caused by their department or by IBM without mentioning a word about the crime itself. 

But he did not blame them. Because this was *their* part. Their job. Yes someone did get away and that fact surely was giving some of them the creeps, but at the end of the day they weren't neither able nor required to solve crimes. They were there just to support the system that did it.

---

Vince had to examine a lot of new faces before seeing a familiar one. It was Robert Jenkins who used to work as the head of the "Homicide" department, back when this department existed. He remembered him as a brave and courageous fellow who knew how to handle stress. So he went to his desk without giving it a second thought:

'Hey Bobby. Heard what happened today?'

'No...' Robert turned to him slowly. 'What happened?'

'We might have a homicide.' Vince said, 'Murder! Its been how long?'

Robert said nothing.

'About fifteen minutes ago a woman calls 112,' Vince continued 'Five minutes later she is found dead. It is probably nothing. But it seems to me that you are the man who can confirm that. I want you at the crime scene in one hour, looking for...'

'Stop it, Vince.' Robert said. 'You know I am just a first-level guy now.'

'Alright.' Vince said. 'If you want a raise that is no problem.'

'No, I *don't* want a raise.' Robert responded.

Vince thought that he had mishearded him at first, but then he looked more carefully at his old colleague. His cheeks were all wrinkled, he wore big glasses and behind them, his eyes looked jaded and tiresome.

'I am *sixty six years old*, Vince.', he continued. 'I even quit for a year when you killed my department. I went back just because I have too many friends here. So don't get me wrong, I want to help you. But to deal with corpses? To go and go through the tracks of people who are capable of killing me? I am sorry but if that is what's required I will be forced to leave.'

'Alright. Pack up your stuff then.' Vince said.

And then he walked to the parking lot alone.

Den Lee
---

Vince got into his car and heard it pronounce the address of the incident - it was somewhere at the Asian district, as he had suspected. The car proceeded to its destination, while the speakers were serving him information about the victim:

'Her name was Den Lee. Born in an upper-class family in Japan. Her parents are still alive. She also has a sister.'

'Skip that.', Vince said.

'Alrighty... She lived in London for about five years. She lived alone. Did not work full-time. Made her living by selling handcrafted wooden dolls. The so-called "Kokeshi" are a traditional Japanese dolls which originate from the northern part of the country. They are characterized by the use of floral motives and...'

'Not the most useful piece of information' - Vince thought and pressed "Next".

'She does not maintain social contacts... No data found regarding her Internet usage...'

The computer kept on going, but Vince was no longer listening to it.

The Crime Scene
-------

He decided to enter the building from where Den called through the back door. He did not want some journalist to make the wrong impression, preferred the case to be recorded as the suicide that it most likely was. He climbed through the stairs and relied on his smartphone to lead him to the entrance of the apartment. When he got there he unwillingly opened the door.

The first thing that he saw was his own baffled expression - there was a big antique mirror which were laying in the hallway. He stepped into the apartment. All other furniture that he saw was really old too. Indeed the whole place seemed to him to resemble those historic house museums that he used to visit as a child - There was nothing in there that was less than fifty years of age: the doors were locked using latches, most kitchen appliances were mechanical, and at the end of the hallway (he did not believe it at first) laid a stationary phone. He wasn't even sure if it worked with the contemporary networks, but he concluded that it somehow did - aparently this was the device that Den used to call 911.

Vince followed her footsteps down to the living room. The furniture there was placed randomly across the room as if the person who arranged it cared neither for aestetics nor for convenience, there were a couple of big cabinets - all of them filled with drawing materials, and centered stood a big desk with different colours of paint poured all over it. Everywhere there were pieces of cut wood, some of them roughly shaped in the form of a stylized human body. Upon inspection Vince noticed that there wasn't a single finished doll in the apartment. But he was too occupied to think about that. At the bottom of the room there were several french windows, extending from the floor up to the ceiling. And one of them was broken. 

Vince went to take a look through it, but quickly turned his head away - He wasn't sure how much of what he saw was real and how much was complemented by his imagination, what he knew was that he wasn't looking down again, for the world. For the first time he realized how serious his situation was. What if it *was* a murder? Then he would be responsible for securing the city and aparently there wasn't a single person in his team that knew what to do in case of such thing happening, including himself.

So he called Jane:

'Hi Vince. Did you reach her apartment?' She looked somewhat concerned when she answered him, which was unusual for her.

'Yup.' Vince said.

'And...'

'It feels weird...' Vince said but coundn't think of any way to finish his sentence.

'Weird? The hell does that mean? Did you find something?'

'No.' Vince said. 'I haven't found anything.'

'Close the case and go home then.' Jane said. 'Nothing suspicious - nothing to worry about.'

'But...'

'And also stop looking like a scared child.'

After a hour later Vince went back to his office to fill out the reports. It was an easy job, because most of the information was already there, generated by the system. Essentialy all he needed to do was hit the "Close" button. And he knew that he had all reasons to do so, still when the time came, he moved his finger and touched the button next to it: “Requires further investigation”.

The Asian District
-------

Vince were standing by his front door. Jane had said that she would pick him up in the morning. She did not tell him where they were going, but Vince was accustomed to that - his colleague was so reluctant to explain herself that often the best way to find out what she had in mind is just to wait for her to act it. However when her car shifted to the direction opposite to the city, Vince decided that currently he could not afford to do so:

'Where are we going?', He asked.

'The Asian District.'

Vince waited a little to make sure she does not intend to say anything else and then turned to her again.

'And what are we doing there?'

'Trying to find help.'

She drove in silence untill a little before they reached their destination. Then Jane had to slow down her car because a pack of around ten children were running round the street chasing a ball. Jane honked at them several times, but they did not seem to pay any attention to her, so she was forced to stop her car.

'Do all parents in this neighbourhood think that it is a good idea to let their children do whatever they like all day?', she said.

'Apparently.' Vince said. 'But look it from the bright side. This gives us time to talk about things. Like 'Why is the sky blue?'.Or 'What are we doing here?'

'Alright,' Jane said. 'So yesterday this guy Robert came to me to beg me not to fire him. I tried to get him to help us. He said that he couldn't, but he knew someone who could.

'And...'

'So after we killed the homicide department our pal Bobby had quit the Yard for a while and had started working part-time at some dry cleaning joint somewhere uptown. There were often on shift with a boy named Ayer Cadman. Ayer was silent boy, and so he decided to break the ice with some stories about his past as a policeman.'

'Oh, brother.', Vince remembered how Bobby used to storm all kinds of corporate events and bore everyone to death with his incredibly verbose accounts of, mostly trivial, police operations. His stories had neither a beginning nor an end, and each of them inevitably reminded him of at least three more.

'Yeah, but it seems that the boy bought it. It strived for more and more of his narratives and demanded an even greater detail. And gradually... You remember those kinds from back when we were at school who had no life but knew everything about, say, Word War Two?

'I do.', Vince thought of himself for some reason.

'Well, Ayer was the same case, but with classical forensic science.' Jane said. And the last think Bobby told me was that recently he had heard that Ayer again - apparently he had moved somewhere round this district to realize his passion...'

'What do you mean?'

'You know there are a lot of of illegals here. Low Teks if you will - people who spend their life off the grid to a certain extend. This, combined with the fact that our coverage at this area is still weak, makes it a perfect platform for all kinds of crime-hunting vigilantes. You remember back in the days when there was this profession called "private detective"?'

'Yes, but I don't follow you.', Vince said.

'Say you live here and someone stoles your car but for some reason you don't want to go to report the teft to the police. Well, you have an alternative. You go to Ayer, you give him some money, and if you are lucky he finds it for you. Clearer?'

'I still don't know how you decided that a person like this can be of any help for us?'

'I don't. But why bother a true profession with a fake case? 

'Do we at least have any information about him, aside from Bobby's tall tales?'

'No. No official withness on any case. Internet presense neither private nor business-related. Looks like he operates from another dimension or something.'

Soon they found out that although online Ayer Cadman was virtually unexisting, amongs the people from this neighbourhood he was quite famous. All of the people they stopped to ask for directions knew who he was and most of them also had a story or two to share: 'Ayer? Of course I know him. I even have a friend who hired him once and...'

None of them knew who any of them were.

Meeting Ayer Cadman
-------

At the end of a winding road, surrounded from all sides with much taller buildings, which hid it from the sight of most people, stood was a monolithic old house. According to the people Vince and Jane spoke to, this house functioned as both home and an office for Ayer Cadman, but on it there weren't signs accounting for either of those things. Vince and Jane stood by the door wandering if they should ring at all but at the end Vince mumbled something about not going to the end of the city in vain and pressed the single doorbell.

An elderly woman opened the door:

'He is upstairs.', she said before they had a chance to ask her.

They nodded and climbed the stairs in silence while looking at each other, as if they were having some telepathic conversation.

They found themselves in a spacious room, with a very high ceiling. and very beautiful, albeit run-down furniture. Newspaper clippings were spread all over the table. He went so see them: they were mainly from articles about last week's robbery, and most of the text was crossed out with a black marker. As in Den Lee's apartment smart home appliances weren't being respected - the only electronic he could see was an old tablet which stood on the table gathering dust.

Shortly after, Vince realized that the woman had just let them in Ayer Cadman's home without notifying Ayer himself which made him feel awkward, so he proceeded to fix this as soon as possible.

'Mister Cadman!', he said.

'Yes, do come in.', someone replied.

It was the voice of a boy.

---

Ayer Cadman's appearance wasn't one that deserved long description: he was around 21 years of age. He was dressed a little more formal than one would dress if he was at home, but not so formal so to make him look like he was at work. His pants were all worn out, his hair - shaggy, and he was leaning back on his chair with his arms behind his head. His expression was deadpan, up to the point that neither Vince nor Jane could sense how he felt about them coming. Was he angry that they came without notice? Was he going to talk? Or he would just stare at them without saying a word until they leave?

After a while Ayer looked at each of them top to bottom and nodded:

'Gentlemen. Sit if you want.'

'No thanks,' Vince said. 'Ayer Cadman, right? You reputation precedes you.'

'I can see that.' The boy said. 'If it weren't so you wouldn't consider hiring me for something as serious as a murder.'

-------

'Alright.', Ayer said. 'Can I hear some details about the case?'

'Not until we hear what *you* already know.', Jane said. 'All of it. The other case will be threated as fellony.'

'But I don't know anything, Missis.' 

'Yeah, right.'

'I just deduced it. That is what I do.', Ayer said as if he did not understand the irony. 'And I am not some genius mastermind, nor I am trying to look as such - I sometimes even try to shut my mouth and act surprised at what my clients tell me. It is just that sometimes what they tell me is actually very obvious not a secret and this makes me look too uninformed. So that is why I try to squeeze all the information of each think that a person says to me and act like I know it for ages.

'But we haven't told you anything.'

'One does not speak only with his words, Missis...'

'Call me Jane.'

'OK. So, Jane, you woild probably agree that by looking at your appearance I can guess your approximate age.

'Probably.'

'And your profession as well...'

'OK, I will give you that.'

'But I haven't done anything illegal recently, and nowadays the false flags are very rare. So why are you here than? The next most possible explanation is that you are looking for help. But wait a second - this is not a standard practice. So to do it you must be in very seniour positions, possibly even C-level. That would explain your age too, as most of the people who work with you are pretty young...' 

'I admit that my last proposition was a bit fuzzy,' he continued after a while ' so you can easily question its validity. You may, for instance, say 'But noone killed anyone in this city for years', and you will be right. You may say that there is a huge unsolved crime from just a week ago.' and your remark will be valid. Still it is my firm conviction that there is only one kind of crime that can cause such radical alteration of your way of doing things. Only one kind of crime that can lead the leaders of one of the biggest organizations in this city in my humble office. And apparently, at least when it comes to our current situation, I was correct.

'Keep your shirt on.', Jane said. 'You just got lucky. Plus, we are not even sure its a real case. In fact it most probably is nothing, we just need someone to confirm it, before we close the case. And if we like the way you work we may hire you full-time'.

'I am afraid that will not possible,' Ayer said. 'I work alone', he added when Vince gave me an inquiring glance.

'And we don't work with contractors,' Jane said. 'You will be employed part time first and full-time later, or you will not work for us at all.

'Well then, I hope you reconsider that policy.'

'Ayer, we have a girl that lies dead in the mourgue for fuck sake,' Jane said, 'If you really believe you are any good as you obviously do, what is your excuse for staying in your room jerking off to your principles instead of helping us?

'Well if *you* think that I am any good you would...'

'But we don't think that. Even if we did, we represent a big powerful organization with hundreds of employees which does not make exceptions just because, and on top of it are workflows and systems that are bigger than any of us. So changing our policy is not an option.'

'OK. I accept,' Ayer said finally, 'I will try to help you. But I don't want my identity disclosed in any way.'

'Boss,' Jane was trying hard not to sound ironic. 'Your call.'

'Alright, we will hire you.' Vince said. 'But I am warning you not to deviate from our procedures. The Yard is not a place for experiments' 

And as soon as he said that Vince immediately realised that hiring Ayer was itself an experiment and a dangerous one as well - he'd alredy seen how smart he was and he knew farely well that a person does not gain that kind of intelligence by following the rules and doing what they are told.

-------

'Alright, gentlemen.', Ayer said after consulting with his huge paper notebook for a minute. I will be at your office at eight. Any questions?

'I have one.', Jane said. 'Where the hell have you learned to talk like that?'

'From books, genlemen. From *these* books.

Up to that point Jane didn't see that the whole wall next to Ayer's desk was filled top to bottom with bookshelfs. Historic accounts, novels, textbooks of forensic science... Some of the newer ones, she knew from her college days, the older ones she'd only heard about. She noticed a small book which, judging from its appearance was at least 100 years old. She took it out and opened a random page. The text sounded interesting but a little pretentious. Somewhat like the name of the author - a guy named Sherlock Homes.
