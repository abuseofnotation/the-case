The Case
=======

*...in which a crime gets commited that is so unprecedented that there is noone who knows how to solve it.*
 
The Call
----

She picked up the receiver, thinking about the end of her shift. Working in "112" wasn't nearly as exciting as it used to be. The line was rarely used for emergencies these days, mostly calling were old people who were becoming more and more paranoid with age, eventhough the crime rate was approaching zero. 

'Your name please?' she said.

'助けて!' The answer came with a second delay and it was in a language that she did not understand. 

'Can you speak in English please?' She said.  
But the woman at the other end did not fulfil her request, which was unnerving because she seemed genuinely scared.

'Where are you? Where do you live?

'Reggie Street.' she said.

Those were her last words.

Jane
-------

The office of Jane Marthello was a huge dusty room, which also served as a warehouse for pieces of evidence, which were piled all around it. Vincent, the current CEO of Scotland Yard did not like to go there but from time to time he had to, since Jane was the only person from his colleagues whom he could speak freely without fearing he might be misunderstood.

'Hello my friend,' she said to her, instantly disposing of the formal manner with whivh he usually conversed with his colleagues. 'I think he might have a problem.'

She turned her head away from her screen and towards him, looked at him for a moment and then turned again to the screen.

'We do.' she said. 'We have had it since last week, when stuff started happening...'

'I am not talking about that.'

She looked at him again, just to show him her angry grimace: 'I know what are you talking about.'

'And?'

'And unlike you I did my homework. Double-checked the recordings of all cameras from around this woman's house. Added some stats from the security system of the building, and I concluded that nobody but her had visited her apartment. There was noone to throw her out the window. She jumped herself.'

'OK, but you know... The call. And the system registered a suspition. How are we gonna finish the case workflow-wise, if you will?'

'Like I am the person who decides that.'

They spend the next minutes in silence.

'OK.' Vince said finally. 'I agree with you. But... After what happened last week, I feel that we should be extra cautious. Still, the robbery of the public vault is a real case and, so keep on digging into that ,and I will get someone to come with me to Den's apartment and try to see if there is anything there.'

'Good luck with that.' Jane said. Vince spent a second trying to determine if she was being ironic ('You fool! of course she was').

Boffins
-------

Vince started roaming through the office space, looking for someone whom he could assign this task. While doing so he realized for the N-th time how many of the people he used to work with were gone, and how little he knew about the new guys...

Most of them were programmers. 

When he started working at the Yard, the IT department was situated in one small room in the basement of the building where three boys were supporting a simple document-maintenance system. From then on it grew steadily and over the years it reached the point were everything was IT, everything was maintenance and the whole workforce of Scotland Yard consisted of about ten interns who were mostly doing the arrests and about 350 boffins (that is how they called all techies) who spoke only between themselves, had lunch in front of their computers and had were only indirectly related to the process of crime-solving. 

That last proposition was confirmed by the calmness with which they reacted to some recent events: last week there were a robbery worth millions of pounds and a few injured victims but all they did was involve him in an endless argument about whether the technical issue because of which the criminal escaped was caused by their department or by IBM, without mentioning a word about the crime itself. But (he realized it just now) this was normal. Because this was *their* part. Their job. Yes someone did get away and this surely was giving some of them the creeps, but at the end of the day they weren't there to solve crimes. They were there to support the system that did it.

---

After some wandering, Vince finally saw a familiar face: Robert Jenkins, who used to work as the head of the "Homicide" department, back when this department existed. He remembered him as a brave and courageous fellow who knew how to handle stress. He ran to him immediately.

'Hey Bobby. Heard what happened today?'

'No...' Robert turned to him. 'What happened?'

'We might have a homicide.' Vince said.

Robert said nothing.

'About fifteen minutes ago a woman calls 112. Five minutes later she is found dead. It is probably nothing, but I suspect that she might be murdered. And it seems to me that you are the man who can confirm that. I want you at the crime scene in fifteen minutes, looking for tracks...'

'Stop it, Vince.' robert said. 'I am just a first-level guy now.'

'Alright. If you want a raise that is no problem.'

'No, I don't want a raise.' Robert responded immediately.

At first Vince thought that he did not heard him correctly, but then he looked more carefully at his old colleague. His cheeks were all wrinkled, he wore big glasses, and  behind them, his eyes looked jaded and tiresome.

'I am *sixty six years old*, Vince.', he said. 'I had even quit for a few years when you killed my department. I went back just because I have too many friends here. I want to help you. But to deal with corpses? To go and go through the tracks of people who are capable of killing me? I am sorry but if that is what's required I will be forced to leave.'

'Alright. Pack up your stuff then.' Vince said.

And then he walked to the parking lot alone.

Den Lee
-------

Vince got into his car and heard it pronounce the address of the incident - it was somewhere at the Asian district as he had suspected. The car proceeded at the destination moving with exactly 50 miles per hour while the speakers were serving him information about the victim:

"Her name is Den Lee. Born in an upper-class family in Japan. Her parents are still alive. She also has a sister."

"Skip that". - Vince said.

"Alrighty... She lives in London for about five years. She lives alone. Does not work full-time. Makes her living by selling handcrafted wooden dolls. The so called "Kokeshi" are a traditional Japanese dolls which originate from the northern part of the country. They are characterized by the use of floral motives and...

"Not the most useful piece of information" - Vince thought and pressed "Next".

"She does not maintain social contacts... No data found regarding her Internet usage...

The computer kept on going but Vince was no longer listening to it.

The Crime Scene
-------

He decided to enter through the back door - he didn't want some journalists to take the wrong impression, preferred the case to be recorded as the suicide that it most likely was. He climbed through the stairs and left his smartphone lead him to the entrance of the apartment. When he got there he unwillingly used it to open the door.

The first thing that he saw was his own baffled expression - there was a big antique mirror which was hanging in the hallway. All other furniture there looked really old too. Indeed the whole place seemed to Vince like those historic house museums that he used to visit as a child - There was nothing in there that was less than fifty years of age: the doors were locked using latches, most kitchen appliances were mechanical, and at the end of the hallway (he did not believe it at first) laid a stationary phone. He wasn't even sure if it worked with the contemporary phone networks, but he concluded that it somehow did - aparently this was the device that Den used to contact them.

Than Vince followed Den's footsteps down to the living room. The furniture was placed randomly across the room as if the person who arranged it cared neither for aestetics nor for convenience. There were a couple of big cabinets - all of them full with drawing materials. Centered stood a big desk with different colours of paint poured all over it. Everywhere there were pieces of cut wood, some of them roughly shaped like human bodies. Upon inspection Vince noticed that there wasn't a single finished dolls, but he was too occupied to think about that. At the bottom of the room there were several french windows, extending from the floor up to the ceiling. One of which was broken.

Vince went to take a look through it, but quickly turned his head away - He wasn't sure how much of what he saw was real and how much was complemented by his imagination, what he knew was that he wasn't looking down again for the world. For the first time he realized how serious his situation was. What if it *was* a murder? He was responsible for the whole city and yet apparently there wasn't a single person from his team that knew what to do in case of such thing happening, including himself.

'Did you reach her apartment?' Jane looked somewhat concerned when she called him, which was unusual for her.

'Yup.' Vince said.

'And...'

'It feels weird...' Vince said coundn't think of any way to finish his sentence.

'Weird? The hell does that mean? Did you find out something?'

'No.' Vince said. 'I haven't found out anything.'

'Close the case and go home then.' Jane said. 'Nothing suspicious. Nothing to worry about.'

'But...'

'And also stop looking like a scared child.'


Vince went back to the office to fill out the reports. It was easy because most of the information was already there, generated by the system. Essentialy all he needed to do was hit the "Close" button, and he knew that he had all reasons to do so. Still when the time came, he moved his finger and touched the button next to it: “Requires further investigation”.

The Asian District
-------

Jane said she will pick him up in the morning. She did not tell him where they were going, but Vince was accustomed to that - his colleague was so reluctant to explain herself that at often times the best way to find out what she had in mind is to wait a little. However when her car shifted not to their office but to the opposite direction, Vince decided that currently he could not afford to do so:

'Where are we going?', He asked.

'The Asian District.'

Vince waited a little to make sure she does not intend to say anything else and then turned to her again.

'And what are we doing there?'

'Trying to find help.'

At the next moment, Jane had to slow down her car because a pack of 10-12 children were running round the street chasing a ball. Jane honked at them, but they did not seem to pay any attention so she stopped the car and turned to Vince:

'Alright,', Jane said. 'so yesterday this guy Robert came to me to beg me not to fire him. I tried to get him to help us again. He said that he couldn't, but he knew someone who could.

'And...'

'So after we killed the homicide department our pal Bobby had quit the Yard for a while, and he started working part-time at some dry cleaning joint somewhere uptown. There he was often on shift with the son of the owner - a boy named Ayer Cadman. Ayer was silent boy, and so he decided to break the ice with some stories about his past as a policeman.'

'Oh, brother.', Vince remembered how Bobby used to storm all kinds of corporate events and bore everyone to death with his incredibly verbose accounts of, mostly trivial, police operations. His stories had neither a beginning nor an end, and each of them inevitably reminded him of at least three more.

'Yeah, but it seems that the boy bought it. It wanted more and more of his narratives and with an even greater detail. And gradually... You remember those kinds from back when we were at school who had no life but knew everything about, say, WW2?

'I do.', Vince thought of himself for some reason.

'Well Ayer was the same except with classical forensic science.' Jane said. 'Anyway, the last think he told me was that recently he had heard about Ayer again - he had moved somewhere round this district. There are a lot of of illegals here. Low Teks if you will - people who don't spend all their life hooked online. This combined with the fact that our coverage is weak makes this area a parfect place for crime-hunting vigilantes. You remember back in the days when there was a thing called "private detective"?'

'Yes, but I don't follow you.', Vince said.

'Say you live here and someone stoles your car but for some reason you don't want to go to report the teft to the police. Well, you have an alternative. You go to Ayer, you give him some money, and if you are lucky he finds it for you. Clearer?'

'I still don't know how you decided that a person like this can be of any help for us?'

'I don't. But why bother a true profession with a fake case? And besides, what else can we do?'

'Do we at least have any information about him, aside from Bobby's tall tales?'

'No. No official withness on any case. Internet presense neither private or as a business-related. Looks like he operates from another dimension or something.'

At that moment the only think they knew for sure about Mr Cadman was that, in this neighbourhood, he was quite famous. All of the people they stopped to ask for directions knew who he was and most of them also had a story or two to share. 

None of them knew who any of them were.

Meeting Ayer Cadman
-------

At the end of a winding road, surrounded from all sides with taller buildings stood was a monolithic old house. According to the people they spoke to, this house functioned as both home and an office for Ayer Cadman, but there weren't signs accounting for either of those things. Vince and Jane stood by the door wandering if they should ring at all, but at the end Vince mumbled something about not going to the end of the city in vain and pressed the single button next to the door.

An elderly woman opened the door:

'He is upstairs.', she said before they had asked her anything.

They nodded and climbed the stairs in silence while looking at each other, as if they were having some telepathic conversation.

They found themselves in a big room furnished with Victorian style furniture but so run-down that it seemed like it was left untouched since the corresponding period. Newspaper clippings of were spread all over the table ('papers made of paper', Vince thought, 'that is unusual.'). He went so see them: they were mainly about last week's robbery. Most of the text was crossed out with a black marker. As in Dan Lee's apartment smart home appliances weren't being respected - the only electronic he could see was an old tablet which stood on the table gathering dust.

Shortly Vince realized that the woman had just let them in in Ayer's home without notifying Ayer himself which made him feel awkward, so he proceeded to fix this as soon as possible.

'Mister Cadman!', he said.

'Yes, do come in.', someone replied.

It was the voice of a boy.

---

His appearance wasn't one that deserved long description: he was around 21 years of age. He was dressed a little more formal than one would dress if he was at home, but not so formal so to make him feel at work. His pants were all worn out his hair - shaggy and he was leaning back on his chair with his arms behind his head. His expression was deadpan, up to the point that neither Vince nor Jane could sense how he felt about them coming. Was he happy to see them? Was he going to talk? Or he would just stare at them without saying a word until they leave?

After a while Ayer looked at each of them top to bottom and nodded. 

'Gentlemen. Sit if you want.'

'No thanks,' Vince said. 'Ayer Cadman, right? You reputation precedes you.'

'I can see that.' The boy said. 'If it weren't so you wouldn't consider hiring me for something as serious as a murder.'


-------

'Alright.', Ayer said. 'Can I hear some details about the case.'

'Not until we hear what *you* already know.', Jane said. 'All of it. The other case will be threated as fellony.'

'But I don't know anything, Missis.' 

'Yeah, right.'

'That is what I do.', Ayer said as if he did not understand the irony. 'And I am not some genius mastermind. Nor I am trying to look as such - I sometimes even try to shut my mouth and act surprised at what my clients tell me. It is just that sometimes what they tell me is actually very obvious not a secret and this makes me seem uninformed. So that is why I try to squeeze all the information of each think that a person says to me and act like I know it for ages.

'But we haven't told you anything.'

'One does not speak only with his words, Missis...'
'Call me Jane.'

'OK. So, Jane, you woild probably agree that by looking at your appearance I can guess your approximate age.

'Probably.'

'And your profession as well...'

'OK, I will give you that.'

'But I haven't done anything illegal recently, and nowadays the false flags are very rare. So why are you here than? The next most possible explanation is that you are looking for help. But wait a second - this is not a standard practice. So to do it you must be in very seniour positions, possibly even C-level. That would explain your age too, as most of the people who work with you are pretty young...' 

'I admit that my last proposition was a bit fuzzy,', he continued after a while ' so you can easily question its validity. You may, for instance, say 'But noone killed anyone in this city for years', and you will be right. You may say that there is a huge unsolved crime from just a week ago.' and your remark will be valid. Still it is my firm conviction that there is only one kind of crime which can cause such radical change of your way of doing things. Only one kind of crime that can lead the leaders of one of the biggest organizations in this city in my humble office. And apparently, at least when it comes to our current situation, I was correct.

'Keep your shirt on.', Jane said. 'You just got lucky. Plus, we are not even sure its a real case. In fact for me it most probably is nothing. We just need someone to confirm it, before we close the case. If we like the way you work we may hire you full-time'.

'I am afraid that will not possible.', Ayer said. 'I work alone', he added when Vince gave me an inquiring glance.

'And we don't work with consultants.', Jane said. 'You will be employed part time first and full-time later, or you will not work for us at all.

'Well then, I hope you reconsider that policy.'

'Ayer, we have a girl that lies dead in the mourgue. If you really believe you are any good which you obviously do, then what is your excuse for staying in your room jerking off to your principles instead of helping us?

'Well if *you* think that I am any good, you would...'

'But we don't think that. Even if we did, we represent a big powerful organization with hundreds of employees which does not make exceptions just because. On top of the organization are workflows and systems that are bigger than any of us. So changing our policy is not an option.'

'OK. I will try to help you. But I don't want my identity disclosed in any way.'

'Boss', Jane said trying hard not to sound ironic. 'Your call.'

Vince thought for a second, but not too long:

'Alright, we will hire you. But I am warning you not to deviate from our procedures. The Yard is not a place for experiments', he said, but then almost immediately realised that hiring Ayer was itself an experiment and a dangerous one as well - he'd alredy seen how smart he was and he knew farely well that a person does not gain that kind of intelligence by following the rules and doing what they are told.


-------

'Alright, gentlemen.', Ayer said after consulting with his huge paper notebook for a minute. I will be at your office at eight. Any questions?

'I have one.', Jane said. 'How the... From where did you learned to talk like that?'

'From books, genlemen. From *these* books.

Up to that point Jane didn't see that the whole wall next to Ayer's desk was filled top to bottom with bookshelfs. Historic accounts, novels, textbooks of forensic science. Some of the newer ones, she knew from her college days, the older ones she'd only heard about. She noticed a small book which, judging from its appearance was at least 100 years old. She took it out and opened a random page. The text sounded interesting but a little pretentious. Somewhat like the name of the author: some guy named Sherlock Homes...
