In the Yard
===

*...in which Ayer Cadman comes to Scotland Yard to seek answers but all he finds are more questions*

Pankill

The next morning Ayer was standing by the Scotland Yard headquaters - a big old building surrounded from all sides with green gardens. His looks resembled that of a celebrity going incognito - jeans, monochromed t-shirt and a baseball cap. Still a Scotland Yard employee came for him almost immediately and took him inside.

'Hello Mr Cadman', the man reached out to shake hands. 'My name is Pankill Shah, I am one of the technical managers of Scotland Yard and today I am here to provide you with some technical assistance with our system. Come with me please.'

They entered the building and the man guided Ayer through one of the many corridors.

'As you alredy know', he continued. 'You will be able to use the system from our office only. But apart from that inconvenience we made sure that you have everything you need to do your job. You have a permanent entrance passage... Shortly you will see your private cabinet. Just before that we probably should go through the wardrobe, so you can leave this...'

'It's a sleeping back.' Ayer said.

'Right. But you know you cannot use this here? Offices shut down at nine. Noone is allowed here after that.'

'OK'

'You can discuss this with Mr Blinghorn if you want...'

'With Vince?'

'Yes, but he specifically instructed me that for you there won't be any exceptions. Which reminds me... Please`leave all your gadgets also here. Specifically those which can be used for capturing information - cameraphones, audio recording devices etc. There are scanners for those at the entrance.

While his stuff were being searched, Ayer proceeded to scan Pankill's appearance, but he did not find anything suspicious - either he was very good at hiding his emotionsor he had nothing to hide.

The System
---

'The system which we use is based on a project developed by IBM back in the 90's.' Pankill started. It allows you to inspect reports from all cases that which occured in the last five years, where a case contains information about what happened, clues, suspects etc. Clicking on a suspect takes you to his profile, same goes for victims.'

'Victims also have profiles?' Ayer asked.

'We all do.', Pankill said but did not elaborate. 'Now, your case is in your dashboard. That is Den Lee's case. This is information about her daily routine. People whom she contacted etc.'

'Can I speak to any of them?'

'Well, I don't know, honestly. You are not supposed to need that to solve your case. Any information you need you must request though our system.'

'From this program?  That is a little weird way to work.', Ayer said. 'And it's an weid name too - "Detective". Does this imply that it is meant to replace human detectives?

'It does that, yes.' Pankill said. 'Among other things, that is.'

'Why am I here than?'

'Honestly, I don't know why are you hired. As it comes to Den, all indicators point to a suicide.'

'What indicators?'

'Alright, we might as well start from square one. Currently in London there are about thirty thousand cameras. Using a face-recognition technology, as well as analysing appearance and continuity we identify all people captured by any of them. For instance if we enter your name... Of course this isn't that impressive as you were registered at the entrance, but still...'

On the screen, Ayer saw a map of the center of London. The Scotland Yard building was marked with a red dot.'

'Of course having access to all this information it will be stupid of us not to aggregate it.'

The dot started moving around the map, following the route which Ayer himself took on his way to the Yard starting from the train station.'

'And at the end all location data, combined with many other types of data are fed to a deep learning alghorithm which finds models amongst the behaviours of the people being observed and from then on the algorithm does everything from solving crimes to predicting future tendencies. Questions?

'One. Why didn't all this work last week?'

'What do you mean by "last week".'

'You know, the robbery, which everyone is talking about, but which incidentaly is nowhere to be seen in your system.'

'Maybe someone is currently working on it'. Pankill said after a long pause.

'This can happen again, right?' Ayer looked directly at his eyes. 'Your security has a whole in it. And everyone who knows about it can exploit it.'

Pankill did not respond.

'Look, if you want me to help I need to...'

'My friend.' Pankill interrupted Ayer. 'There are over two million people under our jurisdiction. There are around two hundred of us. The crimes that are commited but are not solved immediately are two or three per month. Undoubtfully we have our our imperfections, but believe me, we don't need help, and neither do we plan to give up on our approach. And you too, if you work at our scale will have to follow it. So from now on, just accept this thing here,', Pankill pointed to the PC 'as your partner.

'I will try.', Ayer said.

And shortly he found himself staring into his screen as well, trying to imagine he was in a place where the streets were more than just lines and the people - more than just dots moving through them.

Then he tried to access its own profile in the Yard database: 

"ACCESS DENIED"

The case
---

The text that accompanied Den's case was short and for Ayer - nearly incoprehensible. It started with very basic information about the victim, (referring to her as some sort of psychopath for not using social networks), and the rest of the file was just a list of random trivia about her and her life. Ayer did not find this stuff rellevant to what hapened. he couldn't even see the logical connection between the individual sentences in the text. But this was all he had, so he proceeded to go through it, swearing at his computer as he did it. On the computer there were a label "0SC4R". Ayer called it "Oscar" and proceeded to talk to it like they were in a 90's American buddy-cop movie:

'Alright Oscar. I don't like you and you don't like me... Or at least you *wouldn't* like me if you were capable of understanding what I am saying... But let's try to cope with one another. Here, let's take a photo together.'

Click.

'Now' he continued while going through the items in one of the menus. 'People say you are quite good.' However what you have for my case is unsatisfactory. So you should give me something else. Show me what's happening in this city, for instance.'

He clicked the search bar and he entered some random criteria. Shortly his screen was filled with a huge list of cases, describing crimes commited around the same area, as Den's. He proceeded to go through all of them, but he quickly lost interest - most of them were as trivial and rudimetary as the style in which they were described - they resembled badly-written pulp fiction. Some were really based on old legendary stories that Ayer had read in his books. That, of course, was how the alghorithm had solved them. 

It did not take Ayer a great deal of time to figure out how the alghorithm worked: it just juxaposed each pending case with a large array of previously-solved ones, and provided it found a match it basically closed the pending case using the match as a precedent. Many of the cases used as precedents were pretty old - so old that it was impossible that the people who commited the new crime would remember the original one. But the machine never forgets. And this, Ayer thought, was the part of the whole thing that was brilliant.

'And you know what else is brilliant, Oscar?' he continued talking to his computer. 'That you made people so stupid that this scheme almost works. However in this case the difference between *almost* and *entirely* is too big for you to comprehend, without your chips melting like fried eggs.'

Ayer then went back to Den's case. For a few minutes, he stared at the first sentence, which was three rows worth of descriptions and analysis from which he failed to understand a word. For a moment he stopped thinking about the case and concentrated at this very sentence. On first glance it looked normal. It was a little dry, but he had worked with even drier pieces of information and had always succeeded to see through the words and form a mental picture of the situation and the objects involved. But here the words were arranged in such an unnatural and weird way that he couldn't do so. Ayer felt that there were *no* human being was capable of constructing such a sentence.

'Wait.'

No *human* being.

'Well of course they are automatically generated.' Pankill responded over from the intercall. 'You think that someone would waste his time writing description for each case individually?' 

And then he heard the phone slamming.

After finishing off his conversation, Ayer decided to take a walk outside. From the moment he got out of his office it became clear to him that, although it was solving a lot of cases, the system was utterly unable to solve those of them which were the fruits of even a little elaborate plans. This, combined with the fact that the Yard did not care to provide him with other means to do his job, was very unnerving for him.

'What am I doing here', he thought while scrolling through one of the countless corridors, which went by all parts of the building like the tunnels of an anthill. 'Why did I say "Yes" to those people.' 

But then he almost immediately remembered why, after being prompted by Jane, he had to say "Yes". He remembered that one woman lied dead, possibly murdered, and that he apparently was the only person who cared to understand what happened to her.

Lost and found
---

'So Oscar, are you still with me?' Ayer soon came down and resumed his conversation with his partner. 'I have a problem with you. I am not saying it's your fault but...  My problem is that I can't understand you. At least not the way I can understand a human being. So I will have to do a little something about it. I think that some people call it reverse engineering.'

Ayer reviewed the long list of files again, this time realising that they are a representation of information, which he was used to seeing in a very different format. He analysed some of the more elementary ones first, in order to gain some insight about the way in which the items in a file related to real-world objects. And gradually, learned to ignore all the bullshit which was there due to the fact that the system were trying to analyse a complex case using methods devised for solving a simple one. Most of the information that he thought he needed was there - all he had to do was to decode it.

But even that did not help him too much. For some reason he was under the impression that once the information was there, the solution would come on its own. But the reality was quite different. Sure, Den had an interesting family history which surely held some secrets, there were some interesting places which she visited on the week before the incident, and many things about her call to 112 could be analysed further, but Ayer could not know if he sould find something in these traces. To determine that he had to analyse each of them by itself, and do a thousand more checks in Oscar's database if he did that, he would sooner or later solve the case. 

And at that moment he wanted to be able to do that - to be able to stop the world for a couple of days an roam freely in the sea of ideas and concepts until he found his way out. But even while he was thinking these thoughts he was noticing how the list of cases were updating with new ones appearing at the top, the boys whom he saw going to school were already leaving on their way home and the arrows of the clock at the law were going in circles, not at all taking his present difficulties into account.

Ayer had just went for a coffee thinking about one trace in Den's file when he realized how he could check one of his theories with Oscar. This realization made him want to go back to his room immediately. But which one was it? He walked back, trying to follow his footsteps but all he was seeing was a long stretch of doors. All of them looked alike, as did the lamps, and the plants which stood on every window. The only things different were the numbers which laid on the doors. For Ayer, this was equivalent to walking in a complete darkness.

Then his glance stopped upon one door at the end of the corridor. It wasn't *his* door, but still it was interesting him, For instead of a number, on it was a hand-written label: "Lost and Found". Ayer did think too much before opening it. 

It was a small dark hallway, which seemed like it was not used. 

Click.

'Hey, who's there.', the voice was coming from the edge of the room.

'Ayer moved so his face was below one of the lamps.

'Cadman.', he heard the voice of Jane. 'What was that sound?'

'I haven't got the slightest clue.' Ayer said.

'And why are you here?'

'I was taking a walk.' Ayer said. 'And I saw the sign. What does it mean by the way?' 
'It used to be a joke.' Jane said. 'Does not matter.'

'Alright, and pardon me for asking but what are *you* doing here.' Ayer asked.

'I work here.'

'I see.' Ayer said. 'You used to work here from the beginning of your career when it was probably much busier than before. When things changed and your position became obsolete you refused to go downstairs.

'False, I never dealed with evidence. Moved here when the first floor was being redecorated into an open space and decided to stay after.'

'Had anyone else expressed his or her frustration with the quality of you reports?' Ayer continued.

'Tell me all about it.', Jane said. 'But if you want to tackle something more productive, what you need is back here.'

'What do you mean?'

She lead him into a dark room which resembled a warehouse. All laws were covered with huge shelves, filled with all kinds of peculiar objects. Some of them immediately reminded him of cases that he had read about in the paper. It didn't take him long to figure out that he was in the Yard's evidence storage facilities.

He went into the room and proceeded to examine each object carefully. There were guns, lock pickers, all kinds of confiscated objects... And all of them were thrown indiscriminately on the shelves, like a... Yes, Ayer now knew where the joke about 'Lost and Found' came from.

'Back here.' Jane said, this time pointing to a big crate, labeled with the number of Dan Lee's case which contained various stuff from her apartment, from notebooks to drawing materials. 

Ayer apologised to her and then, with one swift movement, he tore the crate apart, allowing for all stuff that was in it to roll on the floor. Then he started arranging it in several small piles. 'There is something here', he thought, 'there's got to be something.'

He tried to scan Dan using only her belongings. Standing on the floor of the dark roo, he concentrated with all his mind and at the end he saw her. In his mind Dan was standing on her desk, chopping a piece of wood. Her movements were slow, her face showed indifference towards what she was doing as if she was occupied by something else. Still the piece of wood in her hand slowly took the silhoette of a stylized human. She proceeded to paint it. First she laid the base color and then, with a few quick strokes, the decorations. She then left the doll at her desk and...

Ayer opened its eyes to take a quick glance at he belongings but as soon as he did that her image disappeared and a single thought occupied its place:

'Hey Jane.', he called her when she was just about to leave. 'Is this all.'

'Is *what* all'?

'Dan's belongings... Are all of them here.'

'As a matter of fact they are - the landloard wanted the apartment free in a day, so everything which wasn't his property, we took. Found anything interesting?

'I fancy that the things I *didnt* find are interesting.'

'You are a weird kid.', she answered but didn't ask him anything else.

'Can I use your computer?', Ayer said.

Ayer went back to Dan's file. There were a list of all dolls that she was selling the week before her death. Apparently none of these dolls were found in her apartment. If there was a murder, their disappearance was the only observable trace that he had left.

His Thrusty Polaroid.
---

Ayer glanced an Jane's desk, and, when he realized she had already left, he went to her computer and typed his own name in the Detective's search field. He could not see his profile from his machine. But here he had access to it. And surprisingly, the information there were much more detailed than he had anticipated - it was the biggest file he had seen so far. From parents to relatives to friends, from the school to University, to the first job, interests, and all kinds of other facts were all compiled there, most probably by a human being. 

And the date of last update was today. 

'It can't be that bad.' Ayer thought, but then he saw the list of people who viewed his profile. All Yard employees whom he had spoken to were there, and some of them were even contributing to it. 

He closed the door, looked aroung for a minute or two, just to get rid of the feeling that he is being watched, he went back to the room and started traversing it.

As soon as he got back to his house, Ayer reached in his bag and took out his thrusty Polaroid. It was an instant camera which he had always found very useful. And which apparently none of the Yard's scanners for information-carrying devices could detect. In his bag there were many pictures he had taken with this camera, mostly of objects from Den's crate. They were accompanied by a large data dump from the Yard's system. He knew that downloading stuff from their computers most probably meant that he would not be permitted to visit the Yard again, but he didn't intend on visiting the Yard anytime soon, anyway. 

He started examining the pictures and files one by one, and, with a black marker pen, he coloued all of the space which he thought was irrelevant to him. When he was ready processing a given item, he would place it somewhere in his room, depending on how important it felt for him. 

A central place in this composition was saved from Den's dolls - their alleged theft was probably the first piece of the puzzle. So Ayer started observing them immediately. At first they seemed too similar to one another to be interesting. They looked cheap. And they *were* cheap, as he could confirm by Den's sales history. Then why would someone steal them? The question was obviously central, but maybe it was too early for it. 

A few hours later, Ayer had given names to most of the dolls and had a pretty solid mental images to their appearance. He knew them all of them except a selection of eight dolls which still seemed pretty similar to one another. All of them were painted in almost completely in black, which made their features almost indestinguishable. They eyes were closed. Ayer double checked several times to see whether he wasn't looking at multiple pictures of the same doll. He wasn't. And after concentrating for a full hour at each of them he thought that he found a difference:

It seemed that one of them was winking at him.
