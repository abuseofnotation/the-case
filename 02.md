In the Yard
===

*...in which Ayer Cadman comes to Scotland Yard to to find answers but all he finds are more questions*

Pankill
———

The next morning Ayer was standing by the Scotland Yard headquaters - a big old building surrounded from all sides with green gardens. He looks resembled that of a celebrity going incognito - jeans, monochromed t-shirt and a baseball cap. Still a Scotland Yard employee came for him almost immediately and took him inside.

'Hello Mr Cadman', the man reached out to shake hands. 'My name is Pankill Shah, I am one of the technical managers of Scotland Yard and today I am here to provide you with some technical assistance with our system. Come with me please.'

They entered the building and the man guided Ayer through one of the many corridors.

'As you alredy know', he continued. 'You will be able to use the system from our office only. But apart from that inconvenience we made sure that you have everything you need to do your job. You have a permanent entrance passage... Shortly you will see you to your private cabinet. Just before that we probably should go through the wardrobe, so you can leave this...'

'It's a sleeping back.' Ayer said.

'Right. But you know you cannot use this here? Offices shut down at nine. Noone is allowed here after that. You can discuss this with Mr Blinghorn if you want...'

'With Vince?'

'Yes, but he specifically instructed me that for you there won't be any exceptions. Which reminds me... Please`leave all your gadgets also here. Specifically those which can be used for capturing information - cameraphones, audio recording devices etc. There are scanners for those at the entrance.

While his stuff were being searched, Ayer proceeded to scan Pankill's appearance, but he did not find anything suspicious - either he was very good at hiding his emotionsor he had nothing to hide.

The System
———

'The system which we use is based on a project developed by IBM back in the 90's.' Pankill started. It allows you to inspect reports from all cases that which occured in the last five years, where a case contains information about what happened, clues, suspects etc. Clicking on a suspect takes you to his profile, same goes for victims.'

'Victims also have profiles?' Ayer asked.

'We all do.', Pankill said but did not elaborate. 'Now, your case is in your dashboard. That is Dan Lee's case. This is information about her daily routine. People whom she contacted etc.'

'Can I speak to any of them?'

'Well, I don't know, honestly. You are not supposed to need that to solve your case. Any information you need you must request though our system.'

'From this program?' Ayer said. That is a little weird way to work. And it's an weid name too - "Detective". Does this imply that it is meant to replace human detective.

'It does that, yes.' Pankill said. 'Among other things that is.'

'Why am I here than?'

'Honestly, I don't know why are you hired. As it comes to Dan, all indicators point to a suicide.'

'What indicators?'

'Alright, we might as well start from square one. Currently in London there are about thirty thousand cameras. Using a face-recognition technology, as well as analysing appearance and continuity we identify all people captured by any of them. For instance if we enter your name... Of course this isn't that impressive as you were registered at the entrance, but still...'

On the screen, Ayer saw a map of the center of London. The Scotland Yard building was marked with a red dot.'

'Of course having access to all this information it will be stupid of us not to aggregate it.'

The dot started moving around the map, following the route which Ayer himself took on his way to the Yard starting from the train station.'

'And at the end all location data, combined with many other types of data are fed to a deep learning alghorithm which finds models amongst the behaviours of the people being observed and from then on the algorithm does everything from solving crimes to predicting future tendencies. Questions?

'One. Why didn't all this work last week?'

'What do you mean by "last week".'

'You know, the robbery, which everyone is talking about, but which incidentaly is nowhere to be seen in your system.

'Maybe someone is currently working on it'. Pankill said after a long pause.

'This can happen again, right?', Ayer looked directly at his eyes.'Your security has a whole in it. And everyone who knows about it can exploit it.'

Pankill did not respond.

'Look, if you want me to help I need to...'

'My friend.', Pankil said to Ayer, while staring at the screen. 'There are ove two million people under our jurisdiction. There are around two hundred of us. The crimes that are commited but are not solved immediately are two or three per month. Undoubtfully we have our our imperfections, but believe me, we don't need help, neither do we plan to give up on our approach. And you too, if you work at our scale will have to follow it. So from now on, just accept this thing here,' Pankill pointed to the PC 'as your partner.

'I will try.', Ayer said.

And shortly he found himself staring into his screen as well, trying to imagine he was in a place where the streets were more than just lines and the people - more than just dots moving through them.

Then he tried to access its own profile in the Yard database: 

"ACCESS DENIED"

Oscar
———

The text that accompanied Dan's case was short and for Ayer - nearly incoprehensible. It started with very basic information about the victim, (referring to her as some sort of psychopath for not using social network), and the rest of the file was just a list of random trivia about her and her life. Ayer did not find this stuff rellevant to what hapened. he couldn't even see the logical connection between the individual sentences in the text. But this was all he had, so he proceeded to go through it, swearing at his computer as he did it. On the computer there were a label "0SC4R". Ayer called it "Oscar" and proceeded to talk to it like they were in a 90's American buddy-cop movie:

'Alright Oscar. I don't like you and you don't like me... Or at least you *wouldn't* like me if you were capable of understanding what I am saying... But let's try to cope with one another. Here, let's take a photo together.'

Click.

'Now' he continued while going through the items in one of the menus. 'People say you are quite good.' However what you have for my case is kinda poor. So you should give me something else. Show me what's happening in this city, for instance.'

He clicked the search bar and he entered some random criteria.

'Alright, show me what you got.'

Shortly his screen was filled with a huge list of cases, describing crimes commited around the same area that month. He proceeded to go through them all but he quickly lost interest - most of them were as trivial and rudimetary as the style in which they were described - they resembled badly-written pulp fiction. Some of them were really based on old legendary stories that Ayer had read in his books. That, of course, was how the alghorithm had solved them. It did not take Ayer a great deal of time to figure out how it worked: it just juxaposed each pending case with a large array of previously-solved ones, and provided it found a match it basically closed the pending case using the match as a precedent. Many of the cases used as precedents were pretty old - so old that it was impossible that the people who commited the new crime would remember the original one. But the machine never forgets. And this, Ayer thought, was the part of the whole thing that was brilliant.

'And you know what else is brilliant, Oscar?' he continued talking to his computer. 'That you made people so stupid that this scheme almost works. However in this case the difference between *almost* and *entirely* is too big for you to comprehend, without your chips melting like fried eggs.

Ayer then went back to Dan's case, and the description he could not fully understand (Click). For a few minutes, he stared at the first sentence, which was three rows worth of descriptions and analysis, from which he failed to understand a word. For a moment he stopped thinking about the case and concentrated at this very sentence. On first glance it looked normal. It was a little dry, but he had worked with even drier pieces of information and had always succeeded to see through the words and form a mental picture of the situation and the objects involved. But here the words were arranged in such an unnatural and weird way that he couldn't do so. Ayer felt that there were *no* human being was capable of constructing such a sentence.

'Wait!'

No *human* being.

'Well of course they are automatically generated.' Pankill responded a few moments later. 'You think that someone would waste his time writing description for each case individually?' 

And then he heard the phone slamming.

'So Oscar, are you still with me?' Ayer soon came down and resumed his conversation with his partner. 'I have a problem with you. I am not saying it's your fault but...  My problem is that I can't understand you. At least not the way I can understand a human being. So I will have to do a little something about it. I think that some people call it reverse engineering.'

Ayer reviewed the long list of files again, this time realising that they are a representation of information, which he was used to seeing in a very different format. He analysed some of the more elementary ones first, in order to gain some insight about the way in which the items in a file related to real-world objects. And actually, when he ignored all the bullshit contained in the files which was there due to the fact that the system were trying to analyse a complex case using methods devised for solving a simple one, the connections there were pretty spot-on. In other words, most of the information that he thought he needed was there - all he had to do was to decode it.

While he was exploring the files that he accidentaly solved his first case.

The Case of Guy Moscovitz
———

'Hi! - Ayer sat on the chair next to Vince's desk. I know where Guy Moscovitz is.'

'Ayer, I have stuff to do.' Vince said. 'Would it be hard for you to start at the beggginning?'

'OK. There is a case which I managed to solve.'

'Was it the one we hired you for.'

'No but it might be related.'

'OK, nothing bad in doing more than you are assigned to do, I guess. But I don't think that it can be related.'

For the first time Vince thought he could read a clear emotion in Ayer's face. It was anger.

'Case number 2342,' he started. A man called Guy Moscovitz. Arrived to London from Israel before about a month. Last week he stole two paintings, it was from the Museum of Natural arts I believe, by knocking out two guards and rushing away. He manages to escape but your system locates him without any doubt and five minutes later your colleagues are at his door. But he is not in his room. Neither he is in any other room, nor anywhere else in the hotel. And nobody had seen him since then.

'His identity?'

'Stolen. The real Guy Moskovitz is at the other end of the world.'

'Alright. So what can you to tell me?'

'This person, who stole the paintings, he does not really exist.'

Vince frowned.

'This, by itself, tells me nothing.'

'OK. First I did a small research and I discovered that this was not the first time that Guy Moscovitz becomes invisible. When he arrives in London he allegedly goes from the airport to his rented apartment without any camera recording it. The distance he passed was just one kilometer and he travelled by night but still... Also in all occurences when a camera *did* recorded him, he always looked the same way: large beard, which is almost certainly fake, and a large hat. He did not even change its clothes...'

'Well a person who maintains a fake identity will always try to conceal as much of his real one as possible.'

'Yes, but why bother to leave the house at all, when you know you are being tracked like a lab rat?' Ayer said. 'This does not make much sence. Unless...'

'The hotel where Mr Moskovitz checked in is at the end of the city. It is not a very luxurious place. In fact there are a lot of lower-class folks who live there just because it is a little cheaper than getting an actual apartment. One of them is John Tally who was an ex-burglar. And after a couple of hours I discovered that he and the so-called Mr Moskovitz were never went out of the building at the same time.

'And you think that...'

'Here is what I think. John Tally aquires Guy Moskovitz's identity and uses it to make a reservation at the hotel room next to the one he is living in. Shortly after the plane lands he dresses in his ridiculous suit and comes at the lobby to pick up the key - now your records are in the state in which he wants them to be. And Guy Moskovitz is created.'

'But how the hell did he thought of that?' Vince's question was directed more at himself than to Ayer.

'Well, he just did.' Ayer said. 

'No. You don't understand. That does not happen. Not recently. 

When Ayer got back to his office the case of Guy Moskovitz was already gone.

Full-Time
———

Ayer decided to take a walk outside. From the moment he got out of his office it became clear to him that, although it was solving a lot of cases and keeping the crime rate low to almost non-existent, the system was utterly unable to solve those of them which were the fruits of even a little elaborate plans. This, combined with the fact that the Yard did not care to provide him with other means to do his job, was very unnerving for him.

'What am I doing here', he thought while scrolling through one of the countless corridors, which went by all parts of the building like the tunnels of an anthill. 'Why did I say "Yes" to those people.' 

But then he almost immediately remembered why, after being prompted by Jane, he had to say "Yes". He remembered that one woman lied dead, possibly murdered, and that he apparently was the only person who cared to understand what happened to her.
