In the Yard
===

*...in which Ayer Cadman goes to Scotland Yard to seek answers but all he finds are more questions*

Pankill
---

The Scotland Yard resided in a low but very huge building surrounded by a elementarty school and a park. The following morning, Ayer walked on one of its alleys, along with several first-graders which were on their way to class and by eight o'clock he was already standing by the entrance. He was wearing jeans, monochromed t-shirt and a baseball cap. His looks resembled that of a celebrity going incognito - someone who does not want to be found. Still a policeman came for him almost immediately.

"Hello Mr Cadman", the man reached out to shake hands, "My name is Pankill Shah, I am one of Scotland Yard's technical directors. Today I am here to provide you with some assistance for your work with our system. Come with me please, and we will proceed with the onboarding process."

The man guided Ayer to the entrance - a big corridor with several revolving doors.

"You have a permanent contract with Scotland Yard, so here is your entrance pass. Shortly you will see your private cabinet. Just before that we probably should go through the wardrobe so you can leave this..."

"It's a sleeping back." Ayer said.

"Right. But you know you cannot use this here? Offices shut down at nine and noone is allowed to stay here after that."

"Really?"

"Yes, you can discuss this with Mr Blinghorn if you want..."

"With Vince?"

"Yes, but he specifically instructed me that for you there won't be any exceptions. Which reminds me... You should also leave all your gadgets here. Specifically those which can be used for capturing information - cameraphones, audio recording devices etc. There are scanners for those at the entrance.

While his stuff were being searched, Ayer proceeded to scan Pankill's appearance. The result bore him, but at the same time it was nice to see someone who had nothing to hide for once.

"This is the IT department." Pankill's voice directed Ayer's attention to a huge hall stuffed with desks and people. The place reminded Ayer of a commune - there were a lot of computer desks, but also relax zones with ping-pong tables and videogames. Even the canteen could be seen through several layers of glass. Everything was so revealing that Ayer even felt uncomfortable watching the people who work there, eventhough they didn't seem to mind. "Ninety nine percent of our workforce is here." Pankill stated.

"I suppose that includes me, now?" Ayer said, trying to picture himself in this setting.

"No. You will be on the upper floor," Pankill said and took him to to an older and a more traditional-looking hallway, "Here is where everything else resides." he proceeded to guide Ayer through one of the many corridors.

The System
---

"The system which we use is based on a project developed by IBM back in the 90's," Pankill started talking, right after they arrived at Ayer's new office, "It allows you to inspect reports from all cases from the last five years, where a case contains information about what happened, clues, suspects etc. So UI-wize, clicking on a suspect takes you to his profile, same goes for victims etc."

"Victims also have profiles?" Ayer asked.

"We all do," Pankill said but did not elaborate, "Anyway, your case is in your dashboard. That is Den Lee's case. This is information about her purchase history, people whom she communicated with etc."

"And can I speak to any of them?" Ayer asked.

"Well, you are not *supposed* to need that to solve your case. Any information you need, you must request though our system."

"From this program? That is a little weird way to work." Ayer said. 

"How so?"

"And it's an weird name too," Ayer continued. "'Detective'. Does this imply that it is meant to replace human detectives?"

"It does that, yes." Pankill said. "Among other things, that is."

"Well, why am I here than?"

"To be honest, I really don't know why are you hired. When it comes to Den, all indicators for her case point to a suicide."

"What indicators?" Ayer asked.

"Let's not get ahead of ourselves..." Pankill said, trying to resume his presenation, "Currently in London there are about thirty thousand cameras. Using a face-recognition technology, as well as analyzing appearance and continuity, we can identify all people captured by any of them. All this data gets accumulated in our database and if, for instance, we have *your* name... Of course this isn't that impressive as you were registered at the entrance, but still..." 

On the screen, Ayer saw a map of the center of the city. The Scotland Yard building was marked with a red dot.

"Of course," Pankill continued, "having access to all this information it will be stupid of us not to aggregate it."

The dot started moving around the map, following the route which Ayer himself took on his way to the Yard, starting from the train station."

"And at the end all location data, combined with many other types of data, are fed to a deep learning alghorithm which finds models amongst the behaviours of the people being observed, and from then on the algorithm does everything from solving crimes to predicting future tendencies. Questions?

"One," Ayer said, "Why didn't all this work last week?"

"What do you mean by 'last week'?" Pankill said.

"You know, the robbery which everyone is talking about but which incidentaly is nowhere to be seen in your system."

"Maybe someone is currently working on it". Pankill said after a long pause.

"This can happen again, right?" Ayer looked directly in his eyes. "Your security has a whole in it. And everyone who knows about it can exploit it."

Pankill did not respond.

"Look, if you want me to help I need to..."

"My friend." Pankill interrupted Ayer. "There are over two million people under our jurisdiction. There are around two hundred of us, and the unsolved crimes are two or three per month. We undoubtfully we have our our imperfections, but believe me, we don't need help, and neither do we plan to alter our approach. And you too, if you work at our scale, will have to follow it. So from now on just accept this thing here," Pankill pointed to the PC, "as your partner.

"I will try," Ayer said and shortly he found himself staring into his screen as well, trying to imagine he was in a place where the streets were more than just lines and the people - more than just dots moving through them.

The first thing that he did after Pankill left was trying to access his own profile in the database: 

`ACCESS DENIED`

Cases
---

The text that accompanied Den's case was short and for Ayer - nearly incoprehensible. It started with very basic information about the victim ("referring to her, as some sort of psychopath for not using social networks", he noted) and the rest of the file was a little more than a list of random trivia about her and her life. For Ayer, this stuff was irrellevant to what hapened. He couldn't even see the logical connection between the individual sentences in the text. Still, he proceeded to go through it, swearing at his computer as he did. Ayer remembered that Pankill that had told him to view the computer as his partner, so he proceeded to talk to it as if they were partners in some cheesy 90's American buddy-cop movie:

"Alright Oscar (This was how he read 045K4R - the PC's model number). I don't like you and you don't like me... Or at least you *wouldn"t* like me if you were capable of understanding what I was saying. But let's try to cope with one another, OK? I didn't ask to be put with you, what I ask is to be professional about it."

"Now," he continued while going through the items in one of the menus. "People say you are quite good. However what you have for this case is unsatisfactory. So you should give me something else. Show me what's happening in this city, for one."

He clicked the search bar and he entered some random criteria. Shortly his screen was filled with a huge list of crimes commited around the same area, as Den's. He proceeded to go through all of them, but he quickly lost interest - most of them were as trivial and rudimetary as the style in which they were described - they resembled badly-written pulp fiction. Some of them were really based on old legendary stories that Ayer had read about in his books. That, in fact, was how the crime-fighting alghorithm had solved them.

It did not take Ayer a great deal of time to figure out how the alghorithm worked. What it did was to juxapose each pending case with a large array of previously-solved ones and, provided it found a match, it basically closed the pending case using the match as a precedent. Many of the cases used as precedents were pretty old - so old that it was impossible for the people who commited the new crime to remember the original one. But the machine never forgot. And this, Ayer thought, was the brilliant part.

"And you know what else is brilliant, Oscar?" he continued, "That you made most people so stupid that this scheme of yours kinda works. However, in the human world,  *kinda works* and *works* aren't as close as you might think."

Ayer went back to Den's case and, after he stared at the first sentence for three minutes without understanding a word, he stopped thinking about the case and concentrated at this very sentence. On first glance it looked normal. It was a little dry, but he had worked with even drier pieces of information and had always succeeded to see through the words and form a mental picture of the situation and the objects involved. But here the words were arranged in such an unnatural and weird way that he couldn't do so, for the world. He felt that there were *no* human being capable of constructing such a sentence.

"Wait."

No *human* being.

"Well, of course they are automatically generated." Pankill responded to him from the intercall, after a few moments. "You think that someone would waste his time writing description for each case individually?" 

Ayer quit the call and stormed out the room. From the moment he got out of his office it became clear to him that, although it was solving a lot of simple cases, the system was utterly unable to deal with those which were the fruits of even mildly elaborate planning. 

---

He took a printout of several case files and sat in the canteen to go throuth them. There he decided to take a different approach - he analysed some of the sipler ones in order to gain some insight about the way in which the items in a file related to real-world objects and then he proceeded to reverse-engineer the system's text generation utilities. It took him a lot of time, but at the end he succeeded: after ignoring the bullshit which was generated due to the fact that the system was trying to analyse a complex case using methods devised for solving a simpler one, he found out that most of the information that he thought he needed was there. 

But even that did not help him much, he just did not know what to look for. Sure, Den had an interesting family history which looked like it held some secrets, and many things about her call to 112 could be analysed further, but Ayer had no idea what to do with these clues. He was missing a starting point. A clear route for his journey. He was missing something that he didn't even realize that he even needed - inspiration. 

He glanced at the people sitting with him. 

Theoretically he could analyse each of the traces by itself. He could do a thousand checks in Oscar's database and, sooner or later, find who took Den's life. The problem was that this process would most probably take the better part of *his* life. And at that moment he wished he could afford that - to be able to stop the world and roam freely in the sea of ideas and concepts until he found his way out. But even while he was going through these thoughts he was noticing how the list of cases were updating with new ones, the children whom he saw going to school were already on their way home and the arrows of his watch were going in circles, not taking his difficulties into account.

"What am I doing here?" he thought while scrolling through one of the countless corridors which went by all parts of the building like the tunnels of an anthill. "Why did I say "Yes" to those people." 

But he almost immediately remembered why, after being prompted by Jane, he had to say "Yes". He remembered that one woman lied dead, possibly murdered, and that he apparently was the only person who cared to understand what happened to her.

Lost and Found
--

The realization that he was alone in solving a murder made Ayer want to go back to his room immediately. But which one was it? He walked back, trying to follow his footsteps from when he exited it but all he was seeing was a long stretch of doors. All of them looked alike, as did the lamps, and the decorative plants which were held on each window. The only things different were the numbers on the doors. For Ayer, this was equivalent to walking in a complete darkness.

Then his glance stopped upon one door at the end of the corridor. It wasn"t *his* door, but still it was interesting him, For instead of a number, on it was a hand-written label: "Lost and Found". Ayer did think too much before opening it. It lead to a small dark hallway, which at first sight seemed abandoned.

Click.

"Hey, who's there?" the voice was coming from the other end of the hallway.

Ayer moved so his face below one of the lamps.

"Cadman!" he heard the voice of Jane, "What was that sound?"

"I haven't got the slightest clue." Ayer said.

"Oh, and why are you here then?"

"I was taking a walk." Ayer said. "And I saw the sign. What does it mean by the way?" 

"It used to be a joke." Jane said. "Does not matter."

"Alright, pardon me for asking but what are *you* doing here." Ayer asked.

"I work here."

"I see." Ayer said. "You used to work here from the beginning of your career when it was probably much busier than before. When things changed you refused to go downstairs.

"False, I moved here when the first floor was being redecorated into an open space and decided to stay after."

"Had anyone else expressed his or her frustration with the quality of you reports?" Ayer continued.

"Do tell me all about it," Jane said. "But if you want to tackle something more productive, what you need is back here."

She lead him into a dark room which resembled a warehouse. All laws were covered with huge shelves, filled with all kinds of peculiar objects. Some of them immediately reminded him of cases that he had read about in the paper. It didn't take him long to figure out that he was in the Yard's evidence storage facilities.

He went into the room and proceeded to examine each object carefully. There were guns, lock pickers, all kinds of confiscated objects. All of them were thrown indiscriminately on the shelves, like in a...

"And this is where that joke about 'Lost and Found' came from." Jane said, "Now check what's there!" She was pointing to a big crate, labeled with the number of Den Lee's case. The crate contained various stuff from her apartment ranging from notebooks to drawing materials. 

When he saw it, Ayer apologised to Jane and then, with one swift movement, he tore the crate apart allowing for all stuff inside to roll on the floor.

"I thrust you will be OK here, yes?" Jane said, while Ayer was arranging the contents of the crate in several small piles.

Standing on the floor of the dark room, Ayer concentrated with all his mind and at Den Lee and at the end he saw her. In his mind, she was standing on her desk, chopping a piece of wood. Her movements were slow, her face showed indifference towards what she was doing, as if she was occupied by something else. Still the piece of wood in her hand slowly took the silhoette of a stylized human. She proceeded to paint it. First she laid the base color and then, with a few quick strokes, the decorations. She then left the doll at her desk and...

Ayer opened its eyes to take a quick glance at he belongings but as soon as he did that her image disappeared and a single thought occupied its place:

"Hey Jane.", he called her when she was just about to leave. "Is this all."

"Is *what* all"?

"Den's belongings... Are all of them here."

"As a matter of fact they are - the landloard wanted the apartment free the next day, so everything which wasn't his property, we took. Found anything interesting?

"I fancy that the things I *didnt* find are interesting."

"You are a weird kid.", she answered but didn't ask him anything else.

"Can I use your computer?" Ayer said.

Ayer went back to Den's file. There were a list of all dolls that she was selling the week before her death. Apparently none of these dolls were found in her apartment, so  there was a murder at all, their disappearance was, so far, the only trace that he had left.

His Thrusty Polaroid.
---

Ayer glanced an Jane's desk and realized she had already left. Her computer was unatended. He went to it and typed his own name in the Detective's search field. He could not see his profile from his machine, but there he had access to it. And surprisingly, the information there were much more detailed than he had anticipated - it was the biggest file he had seen so far. And the date of last update was today. 

"It can't be that bad." Ayer thought, but then he saw the list of people who viewed it. All Yard employees whom he had spoken to were there, and some of them were even contributing to it. 

He closed the door, looked aroung for a minute or two, just to get rid of the feeling that he is being watched, he went back to the room and started traversing it.

As soon as he got back to his house, Ayer reached in his bag and took out his thrusty Polaroid. It was an analog instant camera which he had always found very useful. And which, apparently, none of the Yard's scanners for information-carrying devices could detect. In his bag there were many pictures he had taken with this camera, mostly of Den's objects. They were accompanied by a large data dump from the Yard's system. He knew that downloading stuff from their computers most probably meant that he would not be permitted to visit the Yard again, but he didn't intend on visiting it soon, anyway. 

He started examining the pictures and files one by one, and, with a black marker pen, he coloured all of the space which he thought was irrelevant to him. When he was ready processing a given item, he would place it somewhere in his room, depending on how important it felt for him. A central place in this composition was saved from Den's dolls, as their alleged theft was probably the first piece of the puzzle. So Ayer started observing them immediately. At first they seemed too similar to one another to be interesting. They looked cheap. And they *were* cheap, as he could confirm by Den's sales history. Then why would someone steal them? The question was obviously central, but maybe it was too early for it. 

A few hours later, Ayer had given names to most of the dolls and had a pretty solid mental images to their appearance. He knew them all except a selection of eight dolls which still seemed pretty similar to one another. All of them were painted almost completely in black, which made their features almost indestinguishable from one another. They eyes were closed, he even double checked whether he wasn't looking at multiple pictures of the same doll. After concentrating for a full hour at each of them he thought that he found a difference.

It seemed that one of them was winking at him.
