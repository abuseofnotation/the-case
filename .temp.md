Ayer: I can be like him. If I decide to do so, I can be even better than Moriarty.

We like to imagine that our problems have simple causes and even simpler solutions. here is the man, get rid of him and you will be good. But it is rarely the case. Our problems are often part of who we are. They define us, much better than we want them to. And they cannot be extinguished by some kind of battle. We cannot just get rid of the problematic bit. We must transform the whole system. And hope the new one will be better

Беше започнал и да поддържа контакт с Дейси Лий, но нещата не потръгваха така както той си ги представяше. Той смяташе, че си пада по нея, или поне това щеше да обясни неговата фиксация към личността й още откакто я беше срещнал. Но не знаеше как трябва да се държи с нея. Не знаеше какво искаше тя от него. Защо не го беше намразила след като беше влязал в дома й и я беше обидил? Защо мислеше за него, а не за трагедията, която беше преживяла? Наистина ли й пукаше в какво настроение се беше събудил сутрин. И щеше ли да понесе отговорът му?
