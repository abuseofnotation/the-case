The Case of Den Lee and the Japanese Dolls: A novel
===

The case is a sci-fi detective novel, focusing on the human aspects of technology. It stated as a "Sherlock Holmes" meets "1984" mashup, but it evolved into something much more. You can read it for free here. I don't know what you'll make of it, but I can guarantee you one thing - it will be weird.

To find out more about it, you can also read the [blog post I wrote about writing this novel, called "The case of 'The case'"](/the-case-of-the-case).

> Vince sat next to Ayer, who was standing with his face buried in his hands as if he was about to burst into tears, and waited for him to come down before starting to speak: "Look, Ayer, here's the deal - we really like some of your ideas. And we really want to help you. But in order to do that we have to be assured that you know what you are doing. And at the moment we are not, and cannot be, simply because we don't know anything about you. Because, Ayer, as hard it is for me to admit it, your remark was absolutely correct - the data from your file tells us nothing about who you are and how the hell have you gained the experience that you have. So currently your persona constitutes one more unknown term in our equation, and believe me when I say that we have enough of those already."

Synopsis
===

In a future where crimes are usually rare and predictable, and the police forces rely on sophisticated algorithms for crime investigation, the famous institution of Scotland Yard is reduced to a simple IT organization. Everything works great, until a couple of elaborate crimes force its CEO to recruit Ayer Cadman - a Low Tek, from the rundown part of the city, who had spent his life practicing the lost art of crime-solving the way they did it in the old days. And it looks like Ayer is onto something. Is it true, what everybody thinks, that a murder is something that just cannot happen at this day and age? Or does the fate of the whole city rest on the shoulders of one shy and awkward-looking boy, whom no one knows anything about?
