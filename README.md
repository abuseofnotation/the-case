In a future where the police forces rely on a sophisticated algorithm for analyzing and solving crimes, the famous crime fighting institution "Scotland Yard" is reduced to a simple IT organization. Everything works great, until a couple of elaborately-planned crimes challenge the status-quo and force its CEO Vincent Blinkhorn, to seek help from places he would not otherwise consider.
