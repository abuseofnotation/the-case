# The Case of Den Lee and the Japanese Dolls

*This novella is work in progress. New chapters will be published regularly.*

In a future where crimes are usually rare and predictable, and the police forces rely on a sophisticated algorithms for crime investigation, the famous institution of Scotland Yard is reduced to a simple IT organization.

Everything works great, until a couple of elaborate crimes prove impossible to solve by the Yard's computerized process and force its CEO Vincent Blinkhorn to seek help from places that he wouldn't otherwise consider.

Together with his partner, Jane Marthello, Vince recruits Ayer Cadman - a lone Low Tek, from the other side of town, who had spend his life practicing the lost art of crime-solving the way they did it in the old days. And it looks like Ayer is onto something.

Is true what everybody thinks, that a murder is something that just cannot happen at this day and age? Or does the fate of the whole city rest on the shoulders of one shy and awkward-looking boy, whom no one knows anything about?
