# The Case of Den Lee and the Japanese Dolls

*This novella is work in progress. New chapters will be published regularly.*

In a future where crimes are usually rare and predictable and the police forces rely on a sophisticated algorithms for maintaining public safety, the famous institution of Scotland Yard is reduced to a simple IT organization, where both the arrest.

Everything works great, until a couple of elaborate crimes challenge the status quo and force the Yard's CEO, Vincent Blinkhorn, to seek help from places that he wouldn't otherwise consider.

Together with his partner, Vince recruits Ayer Cadman - a lone Low Tek, from the other side of town, who had spend his life practicing the lost art of crime-solving. And it looks like Ayer is onto something.

Is true that, like everybody says, that a murder is something that cannot happen in this day and age? Or does the fate of the whole city rest on the shoulders of one shy and awkward-looking boy, whom no one knows anything about?
